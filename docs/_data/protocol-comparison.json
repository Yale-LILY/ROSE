Her husband, Eric Isaiah Adusah, a self-proclaimed prophet and evangelical preacher, was alleged to have left the hotel hurriedly on the day she is believed to have died. Whirlwind romance: Charmain and Eric Adusah, who were married last September, were said to have argued during stay, according to local reports. He told hotel managers at the time that his three-month pregnant wife was ill and did not want to be disturbed. A close family friend claimed last night that Mr Adusah, 28, flew back to London but later returned to Ghana after his wife\u2019s body was found by concerned hotel staff who used a spare key to check on her after she failed to answer the door. Mr Adusah, originally from Ghana, is being held in police custody in the African country on suspicion of murdering the former NHS radiography assistant, whom he married suddenly last September \u2013 following a whirlwind romance \u2013 in a wedding which shocked her family and friends.\u00a0. His wife, whose maiden name was Speirs, already had an eight-year-old son from a previous relationship in Wales.\u00a0. Christmas wishes: The couple pictured on a Christmas card. Adusah is the leader of Global Light Revival Ministries church based in Tottenham, north London and has been active as a preacher in Britain since 2010. But the boy has not yet been told the awful news and was staying with his father, a British man, last night. Mr Adusah is the leader of Global Light Revival Ministries church based in Tottenham, north London and has been active as a preacher in Britain since 2010. He has led sermons he describes as \u2018divine visitation\u2019 events across the UK and Ireland, receiving \u00a31million in charitable donations in five years and giving sermons on religious satellite television channels. A close family friend last night accused Mr Adusah of being a \u2018wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing\u2019, telling The Mail on Sunday: \u2018We think he brainwashed her.\u2019. Mrs Adusah \u2013 who was considered the \u2018First Lady\u2019 of her husband\u2019s ministry \u2013 grew up in Arbroath in Scotland, and studied a degree in photojournalism at Swansea University. She worked as a radiography assistant in the Welsh NHS and later separated from the father of her son. She was described as a \u2018free spirit\u2019 who started following Mr Adusah\u2019s church around two years ago. They started a relationship early last year and married in September in London. The couple had travelled to Ghana early this month so Mr Adusah could preach at a three-day religious conference hosted by controversial evangelist \u2018Bishop\u2019 John Yaw Adu, who has been exposed for chaining up mentally ill patients at \u2018prayer camps\u2019 for days on end so he could \u2018heal\u2019 them through prayer.\u00a0. Local reports claim Mr Adusah and his wife had argued at the start of the trip and he had booked himself into a budget motel alone, leaving her to stay with Bishop Yaw Adu. Happier times:\u00a0The body of Charmain Adusah, left, was discovered by hotel staff face down in a bath. Husband\u00a0Eric Isaiah Adusah is being held on suspicion of her murder. Arrest:\u00a0Eric Isaiah Adusah, a Ghanaian British based Pastor, has been arrested on suspicion of murdering his pregnant British wife Charmain Spears. After the conference ended, the couple apparently reconciled and checked into the Mac-Dic Royal Plaza Hotel in Koforidua, where they booked in for five days on March 16. The upmarket hotel has security gates and tropical gardens.\u00a0. The couple were said to have argued over the length of their stay, according to the reports, with Mrs Adusah apparently wanting to stay in Ghana for a month but her husband saying it was far too long. Mr Adusah is said to have left the hotel at dawn the next day and warned reception that his wife did not want to be disturbed.\u00a0. But hotel managers became concerned when she still had not left the room and would not respond to knocks on the door. On March 20 hotel porters used a spare key to gain access to the room. A spokesman for Criminal Investigation Department (CID) at the police headquarters in Koforidua said Mrs Adusah was \u2018found dead in the bath lying prostrate with a white towel wrapped around her, almost in a decomposed state\u2019. Her close friend Christine Stephen, 42, of Camberley, Surrey, who has known Mrs Adusah since childhood, told The Mail on Sunday that the family did not hear about her death until March 21. She said: \u2018I spoke to Charmain\u2019s family and they said Eric had been in touch on that Saturday to say she had died. He said he was flying back to Ghana to identify her body on Sunday.\u00a0. Tragic: Charmain Adusah was found face down in a bath by hotel staff in Ghana. The Global Light Revival Ministries, founded by Eric Adusah in 2010, is a revivalist evangelical movement registered as a British charity and has received more than \u00a31m in donations. It hosts gatherings across the UK and Ireland. He also told them he had returned to England because he had a three-day church event he had to attend here.\u00a0. But he was vague about the details of what happened, saying she had wanted to remain out there to help underprivileged children. \u2018Charmain\u2019s family couldn\u2019t get hold of him after that Saturday, presumably because he had been arrested back in Ghana.\u2019. Mrs Stephen said none of her friends took to him. \u2018We thought he tried to cut her off from us, that he had brain-washed her. What person declares himself a prophet? Charmain was religious but she wasn\u2019t a pastor.\u2019. Mrs Stephen said the family wants to go to Ghana and repatriate their daughter\u2019s body but they cannot afford it. Charmain\u2019s mother Linda Speirs, 61, last night said she had been given legal advice not to comment. A Foreign Office spokesman said: \u2018We confirm the death of a British national in Ghana. Mr Adusah has not requested consular assistance.\u2019. A representative of Mr Adusah\u2019s church said: \u2018There is no story. She died of natural causes.\u2019. \u00a0.

November 2014 - HMS Argyll monitors a heavily armed Russian warship as it strayed close to the UK while passing through the English Channel and Strait of Dover. January 2015 - Typhoons were dispatched from RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland and RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire to intercept two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles as they flew south of Bournemouth. February 17, 2015 - HMS Argyll intercepts a Neustrashimy-class warship and its accompanying tanker as they headed home after a deployment in the Mediterranean in the English Channel. February 19, 2015 - Two RAF Typhoon jets scrambled from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire to escort two Russian bombers in international airspace off the coast of Cornwall. April 2015 - Royal Navy's HMS Argyll monitors Russian Udaloy class destroyer Severomorsk along with a tanker and a support ship as they move through the English Channel. The incursions are the latest in a long line of apparent tests by Moscow as tensions between Britain and Russia rise.\u00a0. The Nato naval operation \u2013 Exercise Joint Warrior \u2013 was aimed at encouraging Mr Putin to calm his recent aggression toward the UK. But Sir Michael Graydon, former head of the RAF, said the Kremlin was using Cold War tactics to \u2018snoop\u2019 on the exercise and called for higher defence spending to defeat a \u2018resurgent\u2019 Russia. He said: \u2018This is a classic return to the 70s and 80s when every exercise conducted by Nato was snooped on. \u2018We\u2019ve trumpeted the fact we are holding such a large exercise and the fact they are snooping on it doesn\u2019t surprise me at all.\u2019. He added that Britain should spend more on defence: \u2018Our capability to deal with these sorts of threats is diminishing because we don\u2019t have the manpower... we need resilience.\u2019. A source added: \u2018It may be that they are observing the military exercise being held off the coast of Scotland.\u2019. Under a European treaty, the Ministry of Defence were forced to accept an inspection by Russian experts and they arrived in Scotland on Monday. Yesterday the destroyer Severomorsk, a tanker and a support ship returning from the Mediterranean were intercepted by the Royal Navy as they passed through the Channel. Plymouth-based HMS Argyll, a Type 23 frigate with a crew of 185, was sent to monitor the vessels. A source said the Russians may \u2018poke their noses in at the exercise off Scotland\u2019 before heading home. An RAF spokesman said the two Bear bombers, which flew off the north-east coast of Scotland hours later, were escorted away. More than 100 Russian aircraft were intercepted last year, three times more than during the whole of 2013. In November a four-strong Russian flotilla sailed through the Channel and earlier this year two Bears flew south of Bournemouth.

HMS Argyle also monitoring three Russian ships in English Channel.   It comes at a time of heightened tension between Britain and Russia."

The unidentified victim will speak out in tonight's episode of Crimewatch in which she tells reporters she is too scared to sleep for fear of reliving the ordeal in her dreams. West Yorkshire police have released a new e-fit of an attacker\u00a0who left a teenager for dead after a savage attack at a bus stop.\u00a0The unidentified victim will speak out in tonight's episode of Crimewatch in which she tells reporters she is too scared to sleep for fear of reliving the ordeal in her dreams. In the programme, she describes how she was waiting for the bus home in the Beeston area of Leeds last month. She was grabbed by the man, who is still at large, and pushed into the garden. There she was bludgeoned several times over the head with a large stone before being raped and left for dead. In the programme, she describes waiting for the bus home when\u00a0she\u00a0was grabbed by the man, who is still at large, and pushed into the garden. There she was bludgeoned several times over the head with a large stone\u00a0before\u00a0being raped and left for dead. The victim told Crimewatch: 'Then it was getting dark. I went to the bus\u00a0stop. I was waiting for a bus to go home.\u00a0. 'I haven't been able to stop thinking about what happened. I've stopped sleeping because I can see what happened when I am trying to\u00a0sleep.' He is described as being of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin, in his early twenties and slim with a receding hairline.\u00a0. West Yorkshire Police are treating the crime as a rape and attempted\u00a0murder,\u00a0and are scouring the area for clues as to his whereabouts. This is the blood-stained rock used by a rapist to hit his 18-year-old victim over the head 20 times before sexually assaulting her in a harrowing attack. A map showing the areas of Leeds, where the rapist had been stalking women on the night of the attack\u00a0. CCTV from earlier the same evening on March 6 shows a man of the\u00a0same description stalking three other women elsewhere in the city. The force have since released a new e-fit of the attacker, based on the\u00a0victim's description. The morphed image uses the previous e-fit and the description given by one\u00a0of\u00a0the women he was caught following. Detective Superintendent Nick Wallen said: 'We believe this new image is\u00a0the\u00a0most realistic likeness we have yet had of the man we are still working\u00a0very\u00a0hard to identify. 'It has been created from the victim's description of him and from the\u00a0recollection of one of the women he stalked in the period leading up to the\u00a0attack. 'I would ask people to study it very closely alongside the other elements\u00a0of\u00a0description that we have already released and think hard about whether they\u00a0know who it is.' In a graphic CCTV sequence the man is seen dragging the woman from the bus stop and into a garden to rape her. This chilling footage was released by West Yorkshire Police in a bid to trace the man who is wanted for rape and attempted murder. The Crimewatch team filmed in Leeds last week using actors to re-account\u00a0the\u00a0harrowing events, including the areas where the three other women has been\u00a0stalked. The reconstruction, which airs on Crimewatch at 9pm, will include\u00a0information\u00a0from the victim's police interviews and comments made as she tries to\u00a0recover\u00a0from her ordeal. Det Supt Wallen added: 'This was an appalling attack on a young woman where\u00a0a\u00a0shocking level of violence was used which could so easily have had fatal\u00a0consequences. 'It has understandably had a very significant traumatic effect on the\u00a0victim\u00a0and that clearly comes across in the emotive comments she has made which feature in tonight's Crimewatch programme. 'We are very grateful to the local and national media for all the support\u00a0they\u00a0have given our ongoing appeals over the last seven weeks. 'Crimewatch is however a particularly prominent platform for the appeal and\u00a0we\u00a0are hoping that among its millions of viewers tonight could be someone who\u00a0has\u00a0that crucial information that could help us to identify this man.' The detective added: 'We are hopeful that the woman shown being followed,\u00a0who\u00a0we have not yet identified, will come forward as a result of this new\u00a0appeal. 'Although we are now seven weeks into this investi gation, our resolve to catch\u00a0this man remains as strong as it was on day one. 'We are continuing to conduct a very wide range of enquiries to identify\u00a0him\u00a0and would urge anyone who thinks they know who it might be to contact us\u00a0immediately.' A reward of \u00a35,000 is offered for any information that leads to the\u00a0rapist's\u00a0arrest and conviction. Anyone with any information is urged to immediately contact West Yorkshire\u00a0Police. \u00a0.",

In two years the Thames Bath Lido, which will sit near Blackfriars Bridge, should open with the backing of a recently launched crowdfunding project. Floated in 2013 the original idea was conceived by three Londoners who dreamt of bringing the beautiful lakes of Zurich to the capital. James Lowe (left), Chris Romer-Lee (centre) and Matt Bamford-Bowes (right) originally thought up the Thames Lido\u00a0. Walliams has said if the water is clean enough he will be the first to jump in. The Little Britain star has been a vocal champion of open-water swimming since he crossed the English Channel unaided for charity in 2006. He also did a\u00a0140-mile charity swim of the Thames in 2011. Tracy Emin said she couldn't believe how underused the Thames is adding 'If you could swim in the Thames, it'd be incredible' Professional bodies such as the Royal Academy of Arts, New London Architecture and many others have also pledged their support for the scheme. The plan is to incorporate two pools, a 25 meter lap pool and a training pool. The baths will also be heated to make them available for use all year around. Founder of the Kickstarter campaign to launch the lido, Chris Romer-Lee said 'Ever since we first sketched out the original concept for Thames Baths, we have always wanted to build something that benefited the community and allowed them to participate in its creation. 'The latter is one of the reasons why we are launching crowdfunding on Kickstarter. We want Londoners, swimmers and anyone passionate about urban waterways to show their support for this project and what better way than a very public campaign.' David Walliams, here pictured swimming the Thames in 2011, has said he will be the first to jump in the new pool. The plan is to incorporate two pools, a 25 meter lap pool and a training pool. The baths will also be heated to make them available for use all year around. The two year plan will include a sophisticated filtration system that would turn the fuel drenched Thames into crystal clear water for anyone swimming in the lido. Floated in 2013 the original idea was conceived by three Londoners who dreamt of bringing the beautiful lakes of Zurich to the capital. The original plan was to create a lido that wasn't just for swimmers, but one that would benefit the local community while also creating a haven for wildlife. The two year plan will include a sophisticated filtration system that would turn the fuel drenched Thames into crystal clear water for anyone swimming in the lido. The local community is set to be a part of the vision of the project too. The facility will be run as a social enterprise rather than a company dictated by profit. A public space created for the people that use it. Thames Baths, the Community Interest Company behind the scheme, is hoping to promote the use of the new Lido to local schools and the elderly. The crowdfunding scheme is hoping to raise a total of \u00a3125,000 within 30 days and a donation of \u00a350 will entitle members to 12 swims. Pledging \u00a35,000 will give investors a year's access to the lido and an opportunity to overview the development project. To donate to the Thames Bath Lido, click here.\u00a0.

        "source": "Former footballer Gary Mabbutt was left with a 30inch scar following a five hour operation to save his leg. The ex-Tottenham and England star, 53, was rushed to hospital after waking up at 1am to find that the leg had gone cold back in 2013. Mabbutt's diabetes had led to a clogged artery in the limb and doctors warned him it was 'touch and go' on whether the leg would have to be amputated. Scroll down for video\u00a0. Horrific scar: Gary Mabbutt has been left with a\u00a030inch scar on his left leg after his diabetes caused an artery to be clogged requiring emergency surgery to save the limb. He was treated at King's College Hospital in South East London, undergoing an emergency five-hour operation. Surgeons were required to replace the main artery in his left leg with a vein and needed 112 staples to seal the horrific wound. Mabbutt, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at 17, will not be able to play football again, leaving his dream of becoming a manager in tatters. As he is unable to train with players on the pitch, he has been forced to turn down roles in coaching.\u00a0. Emergency procedure: Surgeons were required to replace the main artery in his left leg with a vein and needed 112 staples to seal the horrific wound. The Spurs legend has spoken for the first time about the agony he went through and says he hopes to raise awareness of his condition. Speaking to The Sun, he said: 'When they talked about battling to save my leg, I realised I was helpless. As a diabetic you know complications can occur. But you think \"It's never going to happen to me\". It is vital to educate everyone with diabetes how to take care of themselves. If you have anything unusual with your feet, tingly toes, blisters, see your doctor.' In 1982, father-of-two Mabbutt became the first diabetic ever to play for England and captained Tottenham to FA cup glory in 1991. Former star: Mabbutt is pictured, left, lifting the FA Cup while playing for Tottenham in \u00a01991. He was unaware that his diabetes had triggered peripheral arterial disease, clogging up the blood vessels in the legs. Every year, surgeons perform around 8,000 amputations on diabetics in the UK - but campaigners say four out five could be prevented. Amputations cost the NHS \u00a3650million a year - and up 80 per cent of the amputees die within five years. Diabates sufferers are entitled to annual eye tests as they are are 20 times more likely to develop sight problems, but Gary Mabbutt wants a similar programme to apply to feet. Experts say millions of diabetics are unaware their condition could lead to foot problems and agree regular checks could save limbs.\u00a0.",

He required the main artery to be replaced and almost lost his left leg.   The ex-Spurs star wants to raise awareness of dangers relating to diabetes\u00a0."

        "source": "The Health Secretary promised a crackdown if the Conservatives are re-elected. Ending the \u2018abuse\u2019 of NHS money exposed by the Mail will be a priority if the Conservatives are re-elected, the Health Secretary said last night. Speaking as the Mail revealed how NHS managers were potentially dodging income tax by channelling huge salaries through personal companies, Jeremy Hunt promised an immediate crackdown if his party is in power after the election. He said: \u2018The Mail\u2019s campaign has exposed that off-payroll contracts are clearly being abused both at a management level and in the hiring of agency staff. So we will stop the abuse as a priority if we form the next government.\u2019. His comments led a storm of reaction from all political parties, as well as health experts and medical professionals. The Mail yesterday revealed how hospital bosses had taken \u00a335million in pay rises during the worst funding crisis in a generation. And today it can be revealed that some could dodge tax by channelling salaries through personal companies. The practice is being used by temporary executives \u2013 some of whom earn more than \u00a32,000 a day \u2013 and allows them to avoid paying income tax and national insurance in the normal way. Dr Sarah Wollaston, former Tory chairman of the health select committee, said: \u2018I was asked about the Mail\u2019s investigation today at an open public meeting. People are right to be concerned about the best use of public money.\u2019. Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham has also vowed that a Labour government would investigate the Mail\u2019s evidence. And he said the astonishing pay rises should be \u2018clawed back\u2019, adding: \u2018It cannot be right at a time when NHS staff have been asked to accept years of [pay] freezes to see this level of excess at the top.\u2019. The extraordinary pay deals have also been condemned by the Royal College of Nursing, which branded them \u2018shocking\u2019, while health experts including the Royal College of Physicians and government health adviser Sir Brian Jarman demanded a review. Former Commons public accounts committee chairman Margaret Hodge, who investigated tax avoidance by public officials three years ago, said NHS trusts should be \u2018hauled\u2019 before MPs to be held to account. \u2018This is a way of avoiding tax,\u2019 the Labour MP said. \u2018The reason the Treasury took action to stop public officials being paid through personal service companies was because my committee uncovered this was going on. \u2018I\u2019m cross the Government has not stopped this and a future government has got to sort it out. \u2018They should make it a condition that if you are being paid with taxpayer money you have to be properly on the books.\u2019. Roger Goss, of Patient Concern, said the situation was \u2018ludicrous\u2019, adding: \u2018There is no way of justifying it.\u2019. Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, said: \u2018It\u2019s sickening to see top NHS bosses using the tax rules for personal gain.\u2019. Labour's health spokesman Andy Burnham said his party would investigate the Mail's findings if elected\u00a0. \u00a0.",

        "source": "This will prove yet another bitter pill for Saracens to swallow. The hurt of losing back-to-back European and domestic finals last year took Mark McCall\u2019s men all of last summer and a good chunk of this season to overcome. This time they must lick their wounds and refocus their efforts on the Aviva Premiership after coming up short against Clermont. Clermont warm up in front of their supporters at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in Saint-Etienne. Clermont centre Wesley Fofana attempts an offload following a crunching hit from Marcelo Bosch\u00a0. Saracens flanker Maro Itojie secures a loose ball on the deck during a tight first half of action\u00a0. There should be no shame in this defeat. Whereas Northampton capitulated embarrassingly against the same opponents a fortnight ago, Saracens stood tall on Saturday. Saracens\u2019 long-suffering chairman Nigel Wray, who has pumped tens of millions of pounds into this club over the past two decades, took the opportunity on Saturday morning to repeat his conviction that English clubs will never be able to compete with French teams if the domestic salary cap is not raised. But it can only be a matter of time before Saracens deliver. With five of their starting pack under the age of 24 \u2014 all English qualified \u2014 they have forwards who will surely develop into a world-class outfit. Twenty-year-old Maro Itoje was impressive making his first start in Europe, while the Vunipola brothers were magnificent. Ultimately the better side won, and Clermont will head into their second European final confident they can land their first European title. Saracens pressurised Clermont with the same fierce defence that knocked them so spectacularly off their stride in last year\u2019s semi-final at Twickenham.\u00a0. Sarries No 8 Billy Vunipola makes a strong run as\u00a0Radosavljevic tries to halt his progress\u00a0. The difference this time was that Clermont knew what was coming and were able to keep their wits about them, buoyed by a partisan crowd. \u2018I\u2019ve never experienced an atmosphere like that,\u2019 said McCall. \u2019The effort and many aspects of our performance were phenomenal. We made Clermont play a a game they didn\u2019t want to play. The game was on a knife edge with 10 minutes to go but games like that are decided by small margins.\u2019. As evidence of their dominance, Clermont will point to Wesley Fofana\u2019s superbly taken second-half try and a 19th-minute incident which saw Naipolini Nalaga denied what should have been a penalty try. Chris Ashton knocked him into touch without attempting to wrap his arms around him.\u00a0. Saracens full back Alex Goode tries to sidestep Clermont scrum half\u00a0Ludovic Radosavljevic. But, had Jacques Burger been able to cling on to a knock-on from Nalaga with less than 10 minutes on the clock after Richard Wigglesworth\u2019s superb chase and tackle of Alex Goode\u2019s clearance, Saracens could so easily have won this game. It is hard to comprehend how the club will pick themselves up from yet another shattering defeat to deliver domestic silverware. But, after winning at Racing Metro in the quarter final while watching Premiership rivals Northampton capitulate to Clermont two weeks ago, McCall\u2019s men still have every chance of delivering a trophy this season.\u00a0. \u2018It won\u2019t deter us from our goal,\u2019 insisted Wigglesworth, who is playing the best rugby of his career. Richard Wigglesworth feeds the ball into a Saracens scrum as referee George Clancy watches on\u00a0. \u2018It\u2019s easy to focus on the negatives when we have just lost a game like that. But we\u2019re unbelievably proud of that performance and we\u2019ve got a week to rest out battered bodies and go again.\u2019. Saracens face Northampton at Stadium MK next Saturday, before having the following weekend off when they will watch on enviously as Clermont contest the Champions Cup final at Twickenham against either Leinster or Toulon, who will go head to head on Sunday. But on reflection, Saracens will be buoyed by this performance. Itoje is a rare prospect capable of explosive bursts of power and hugely athletic around the field while Billy and Mako Vunipola are two of the most destructive carriers in Europe. They have both returned to their best following a slow start to the season, while Saracens scrum is also in fine shape. Saracens fly half Charlie Hodgson clears his lines under pressure from the Clermont defence\u00a0. Charlie Hodgson missed two critical long-range penalties on Saturday but the veteran fly half has been magnificent this season and the second-half appearance of Owen Farrell from the bench saw the England No 10 make his first appearance since rupturing knee ligaments in January. With Schalk Britz and Brad Barritt both fit again, only the absence of Captain Alistair Hargreaves with concussion-related symptoms weakens McCall\u2019s squad. They will hurt from this no doubt. But in the cold light of day, Saracens will realise many of their boys became men on Saturday. The future remains bright for them on the field.",
        "reference": "Saracens lead 6-3 at the break thanks to two Charlie Hodgson penalties\u00a0.   Wesley Fofana raced onto a Brock James chip for the opening try\u00a0.   A late Owen Farrell penalty kept Saracens in the hunt\u00a0.   But Brock James struck a \u00a072nd penalty to seal the win\u00a0\u00a0."

        "source": "Ronan Ghosh, 39, stole \u00a3200 worth of meat and wine from a Tesco store in Birmingham, court heard. A millionaire company director was caught on CCTV shoplifting \u00a3200 worth of meat and wine from a Tesco supermarket. Ronan Ghosh, 39, was filmed attempting to smuggle the goods out of the store in a bag after paying for other items at the checkout. The company boss heads a global recycling company with a turnover of \u00a316million, lives in a \u00a3500,000 home in an exclusive neighbourhood and runs two BMWs. But a court heard that he was caught shoplifting after heading to a Tesco store following an argument with his girlfriend. His own barrister told the judge the offence \u2018beggars belief\u2019. Ghosh initially elected trial by jury but he then pleaded guilty to theft. Judge Murray Creed imposed a 12-month community order on Ghosh and told him to complete 80 hours\u2019 unpaid work and pay \u00a3575 costs. Birmingham Crown Court heard on Tuesday that Ghosh visited the Tesco store in Stratford Road, south Birmingham, on February 21 and was captured on its security cameras selecting items, including meat and bottles of wine, which he put into a bag. Lal Amarasinghe, prosecuting, said he then went to the checkout and paid for shopping that was in his trolley, but not for what was in the bag. Ghosh was detained by a security guard and police were called. In 2009, the businessman set up RG Recycling \u2013 based in Solihull, West Midlands \u2013 after more than a decade working in the plant and recycling industry. Charnjit Jutla, defending, told the court the firm supplies \u2018high-value machinery for the recycling industry\u2019. He added: \u2018It is a global business. It has a yearly turnover of \u00a316million. It beggars belief as to why he finds himself in this court. He accepts full responsibility for what he has done.\u2019. Mr Jutla said Ghosh, who lives in a tree-lined road in Solihull, was \u2018disappointed with himself and shocked and embarrassed\u2019. On the day of the theft, his father had told him his mother had been diagnosed with skin cancer and that had \u2018worried him a lot\u2019. Mr Jutla said there was also a will being discussed within the family which had put considerable strain on him. Ghosh told police he had visited the Tesco store after having an argument with his girlfriend. He claimed he had not intended to steal the goods. Ghosh, who lives in a luxury \u00a3550,000 house in leafy Solihull, initially elected trial by jury at Birmingham Crown Court but then pleaded guilty to theft. He was given a 12-month community order and must pay \u00a3575 in costs. One neighbour of Ghosh said yesterday: \u2018He has two really nice cars \u2013 BMWs. It\u2019s bizarre that he would do something like shoplifting. He seems really nice and pleasant.\u2019. A number of people in the public eye have been accused of shoplifting. In 2012, celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson was cautioned by police after being caught stealing cheese, onions and discounted coleslaw during five shoplifting episodes in 16 days at a Tesco store in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. The father-of-four later said counselling sessions had identified childhood abuse as a possible trigger for the shoplifting spree. Sue Terry, the mother of Chelsea and former England football captain John Terry, was cautioned along with his mother-in-law, Sue Poole, in 2009 after being caught with \u00a3800 of food and clothes from Tesco and Marks & Spencer in Weybridge, Surrey. In 1990, TV presenter Richard Madeley was accused of taking wines, spirits and soap powder from a Tesco store in Didsbury, south Manchester. He was cleared the following year. \u00a0.",

Dominic Solanke scored late on to put a gloss on the scoreline after a Tammy Abraham double had seen Chelsea take a first half lead. Sportsmail was at the Academy Stadium to see how the youngsters got on...\u00a0. Tammy Abraham smashes Chelsea into the lead with a fierce drive into the top corner. Manchester City (4-2-3-1) Kjetil Haug: Norwegian international has been on the bench for long periods but got the nod and looked shaky under the high ball. That said, powerless to stop Abraham's volleys and Soalnke's killer. 6.5. Pablo Maffeo: Barcelona-born former Espanyol youngster is not the tallest and at times struggled with Chelsea's diagonals early on but grew into the game and could have levelled. 6.5. Tosin Adarabioyo: Manchester lad and England youth international, City's captain was a commanding presence at the heart of defence. Has the movement of Yaya Toure but put a big shift in. 7. Christian Haug goes up for the ball under pressure from Chelsea forwards during the Youth Cup final. Cameron Humphreys-Grant: Has captained England and, like Adarabioyo had his hands full against a vibrant Chelsea attack but stood up to the test well. 6.5. Jose Angelino Tasende: Spanish left-back is not the tallest and was not able to drive forward as much as he would have liked against strong opposition. 6. Kean Bryan: Box-to-box midfielder from Beswick, yards away from the Etihad Stadium, pulled up injured after 36 minutes but battled back bravely but missed a glorious chance to tie things up. 6.5. Manchester City midfielder Kean Bryan tracks the run of Dominic Solanke as City looked to stem the tide. Aaron Nemane: Moved to Manchester from France as a toddler, the wide man who scored twice in the first leg of the Semi Final did outwitted Dasilva with a delightful tap and go but could not find the final, killer ball. Blasted wide when should have levelled. 6.5. Bersant Celina: Kosovan international Celina struggled to fill in for injured star Thierry Ambrose, seeing one shot from the edge of the area easily held by Collins. 6. Manu Garcia: Joined City from Sporting Gijon and the mini David Silva showed some neat touches on the rare occasions he found space. Was largely ineffective and should have done better when teed up by Barker late on. Yanked on 85 minuted. 6. Manuel Garcia gets a shot away, but it was blocked by Jake Clarke-Salter\u00a0. Isaac Buckley-Ricketts: Pacy Mancunian centre forward produced measured finish to bring City level but was marshalled well for the majority of the evening. 7. Brandon Barker: City's star man, the two-footed local lad is tipped for big things at the Etihad but was perhaps guilty of trying to do too much at times here. Did create a fine chance for Garcia with a trademark surge and almost levelled late on. 7.5\u00a0. City's players celebrate after Isaac Buckley (left) had levelled the game in the first half. Chelsea (4-2-3-1) Bradley Collins: The Southampton-born stopper could do little about City's opener and distributed the ball well. 6.5. Fikayo Tomori: Canadian born but eligible for England combined well with Clarke-Salter to nullify City's threat in a commanding-looking partnership. 7. Ola Aina: England Under-19 right-back found space time and time again down the right. Quick, strong and often influential. 7. Jake Clarke-Salter: England Under 18s international often too strong for Buckley-Ricketts and, on the evidence of this sterling performance, is one to watch. 7. Jay Dasilva: Under-21 regular is still 16. Fortunate to escape at least a caution with a from-behind challenge in the first half but was solid at the back and lively going forward, whipping in a number of decent crosses. 7. Ruben Sammut: Scottish youth international covered his back four expertly and kickstarted a number of breaks as City pressed. 6.5. Ruben Sammut plays the ball out in an excellent performance protecting the back four. Tammy Abraham: Two volleys for his 35th and 36th strikes of the season. Big, bold and often brilliant, Chelsea will be hoping the injury that saw him substituted on 67 minutes is not serious. 8. Charlie Colkett: Put in a captain's shift in the centre of the park as the visitors won the midfield battle. Is tipped for big things and showed just why. 7.5. Abraham makes it 2-1 at the Academy Stadium with an acrobatic finish past\u00a0Christian Haug. Dominic Solanke: Scored for England in the European Under-17 Championship Final and put in a powerful shift here, teaming up well with Abraham before effectively killing the tie with a neat third. 7.5. Charly Musonda: The Belgian playmaker, the only overseas man in the starting XI, was quiet by his standards and drilled a decent chance tamely wide. Departed late on. 6. Isaiah Brown: Said to be interesting Jose Mourinho but will not want to dwell on his big moment early on when he blasted over bar when unmarked on the edge of the box. Miss aside, was a constant menace. Substitutes:\u00a0. Kasey Palmer (Abraham, 67, 6): On for Abraham and showed explosive pace straight away but was let down by a hurried attempt at a finish which flew over the bar.\u00a0. Isaiah Brown holds off a tackle from Fikayo Tomori, during another impressive display for the young forward. \u00a0.",

Scroll down for video\u00a0. Prime Minister David Cameron took advice from martial arts pupils in Warrington about the best way to deal with the Ukip leader when they go up against each other in the two-hour showdown. The Tory leader paid a visit to the Kings Leadership Academy in Warrington ahead of the seven-way debate tonight. All of the party leaders have spent the day preparing for tonight's debate, with Mr Cameron facing the prospect of having to defend the Tory-led government from attack on several fronts. Mr Cameron visited King's Leadership Academy in Warrington, where he spoke to pupils about their favourite sports. Chatting in a playground, the Tory leader said: 'In this debate tonight, jujitsu, is that the right thing?' To laughter he added: 'Shall I get Nigel Farage and put him on the floor, is that OK?' Ukip leader Nigel Farage said he was feeling 'pretty good' ahead of his TV test. But later he played down the idea of physical violence, telling reporters: 'It was a joke. There'll be no bodily contact tonight.' Today Mr Cameron insisted he was not nervous and was 'relishing' the prospect of the two-hour debate in the ITV studios at Salford's MediaCityUK. Mr Cameron told reporters: 'It is a chance to get across that we have a long-term economic plan that is working.' For his part, Mr Farage said he was feeling 'pretty good' ahead of his TV test, telling Sky News: 'I hope the truth comes out on some issues. 'Particularly, I shall be arguing and asking the Prime Minister and others, will they please admit that, as members of the EU, we cannot have an immigration policy of any kind at all.' Mr Cameron and Mr Farage will share the platform tonight with \u00a0Labour's Ed Miliband and Lib Dem Nick Clegg, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, the Green Party's Natalie Bennett and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood. It is the only time Mr Cameron will go up against Mr Miliband, with one of them certain to be Prime Minister after May 7.\u00a0. The Prime Minister was accused by Labour of 'running scared' after dodging a head-to-head showdown with the Labour leader.\u00a0. After Mr Cameron objected to broadcasters' plans for three TV debates during the five-and-a-half week campaign, the ITV show marks the only occasion before the May 7 election when the Tory and Labour leaders will face each other. With all the polls pointing to an extremely tight contest, the leaders of the two biggest parties will be anxious to avoid any costly slips while looking for the opportunity to score points at expense of their rival. Mr Clegg said he would go for a walk to 'clear my head' before making his way to the TV studios, while Mr Miliband said the best preparation was 'getting out to meet people'. Labour leader Ed Miliband poses for a selfie with voters after holding a question and answer session in the Town Hall of Bury. Nick Clegg was in Cheadle, Greater Manchester, today while the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon attended the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood. Addressing supporters in Bury, Mr Miliband said the most important people on the night for him were not the other six leaders or moderator Julie Etchingham but 'the British public'. Lots have been drawn to agree where each of the leaders will stand and when they get to speak. The agreed line up behind the podiums will be, from left to right: Natalie Bennett (Green), Nick Clegg (Lib Dem), Nigel Farage (Ukip), Ed Miliband (Labour), Leanne Wood (Plaid Cymru), Nicola Sturgeon (SNP) and David Cameron (Conservative). Names drawn out of a hat also helped to decide who will get to speak first, with Ms Bennett opening proceedings and Mr Cameron having the final word by giving the last closing remarks.\u00a0\u00a0. The two-hour live debate will be be screened from 8pm to 10pm. Each leader will give an opening statement to a studio audience of around 200 people. Conservative Chairman Grant Shapps arrives to meet party activists as he helps with their canvassing in Somerset today. Green Party Leader Natalie Bennett meets supporters in Piccadilly Gardens as she arrives in Manchester ahead of the TV debate. ITV newsreader Julie Etchingham\u00a0will keep order with just one ad break during the two-hour election showdown. Lots have been drawn to decide the order in which each leader will speak, including the opening and closing statements and giving one-minute answers to the four studio audience questions. They will then be allowed to deliver an uninterrupted one-minute answer to each question, before 18 minutes of debate on each question. There will be just four 'substantial election questions' covered during the night.\u00a0. Each leader will then give a closing statement to the cameras, before the programme ends at 10pm.\u00a0. Michael Jermey, ITV's Director of News and Current Affairs said: 'The programme will provide a fair forum for a proper debate between the party leaders. 'Our viewers greatly valued the debates in 2010 and we know many are looking forward to this programme. 'It'll be an opportunity to hear the leaders directly challenge each other and discuss face-to-face some of the big election issues facing the country.",

Terror: One of those distributing the images is a man claiming to be a British ISIS jihadi who goes by the nom de guerre Abu Bakr al-Britani. The first photo shows the blindfolded and bound man wearing a brown jumpsuit as a bearded terrorist lifts an 18-inch long kukri machete high into the air ready to behead the defenceless victim. A second image far too gruesome to publish in full then shows a close-up of the man's lifeless body, with his severed head resting on his back.\u00a0. It is the exactly the same position British and American hostages are placed in after being savagely beheaded by ISIS' British executioner in chief Mohammed Emwazi, also known as Jihadi John. Surrounding the man's lifeless body are dozens of brightly-coloured prayer beads. It is likely the man had been selling the items, which ISIS terrorists consider bid\u2019ah, meaning a 'reprehensible innovation'. As is so often the case with ISIS' brutal public executions and amputations, huge crowds are seen in the streets to witness the man's beheading.\u00a0. Young men and children and seen lining up in a town square and jostling for position as they struggle to get a better view of the atrocity.\u00a0. Horror: The execution in Salah al-Din took place as Iraqi forensic teams working in the nearby, newly liberated city of Tikrit started exhuming bodies from mass graves believed to contain the bodies of up to 1,700 soldiers. Girsly task: ISIS overran Saddam Hussein's hometown last June, capturing the 1,700 soldiers as they were trying to flee Camp Speicher - an air base previously used by U.S. troops on the outskirt of Tikrit. The execution in Salah al-Din province took place as Iraqi forensic teams working in the nearby, newly liberated city of Tikrit\u00a0started exhuming bodies from mass graves believed to contain the bodies of up to 1,700 soldiers brutally murdered by ISIS last year. Kamil Amin from Iraq's Human Rights Ministry said the work started on Monday on eight locations inside Tikrit's complex of presidential palaces, where much of the killing took place. ISIS overran Saddam Hussein's hometown last June, capturing around 1,700 soldiers as they were trying to flee Camp Speicher, an air base previously used by U.S. troops on the outskirt of Tikrit.\u00a0. Later, the Islamic State group posted graphic images online that appeared to show its gunmen massacring scores of the soldiers after loading the captives onto flatbed trucks and then forcing them to lay face-down in a shallow ditch, their arms tied behind their backs.\u00a0. Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq are being led by a highly secretive group of strategists and officials that were once senior figures in Saddam Hussein's army. Despite thousands of foreign fighters flocking to join the Sunni extremist group and starring in their propaganda videos, ISIS' leadership is dominated by ex-members of the late Iraqi dictator's military. Almost all of the regional commanders appointed by ISIS' leader and self-declared caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, played prominent roles in the Baathist army before the 2003 invasion of Iraq and became involved with ISIS either in the resulting insurgency or after the dictator's 2006 death. Influence: Despite thousands of foreign fighters flocking to join the Sunni extremist group and starring in their propaganda videos, ISIS' leadership is dominated by ex-members of the military of Saddam Hussein. One former Syrian rebel who became an ISIS regional commander told the Washington Post that he found that almost all of the highly secretive officials overseeing all aspects to the terror group's day-to-day business were ex members of Hussein's Baathist army. During one meeting in which he dared to disagree with fellow commanders at an ISIS meeting, the man calling himself Abu Hamza was placed under arrest on the orders of a masked man who had sat silently and almost unnoticed at the side of the room, listening and taking notes. Although the enigmatic commander's real name was never revealed to him, Hamza said that he later discovered that the man had been an intelligence officer for the Iraqi army before joining ISIS. The same went for the other ISIS commanders Hamza met, who either used code names or no names at all in the hope of concealing their past as members of Hussein's army. As well as their extensive military expertise, another key element of the commanders' appointments has been the fact the ex-Baathists have extensive contacts among oil smugglers thanks to Hussein's efforts to avoid international sanctions in the 1990s. Crucially, oil smuggling is considered the most lucrative aspect of ISIS' \u00a32 billion-a-year income.",

A new CNN/ORC poll finds 57% feel businesses such as caterers or florists should be required to serve gay or lesbian couples just as they would heterosexual couples, while 41% say they should be allowed to refuse service for religious reasons. That's a shift from a Pew Research Center poll conducted last fall, which found just 49% thought businesses ought to be required to serve same-sex couples while 47% that they should be allowed to refuse service on religious grounds. Since the Pew poll last fall, Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed into law in late March by Republican governor Mike Pence, sparked a nationwide controversy over whether the law allowed wedding-related businesses to refuse service to gay and lesbian couples. Apple, Walmart and the NCAA all spoke out against the law, while some states and cities with Democratic leaders barred spending public money in Indiana. Pence and other Indiana legislators insisted discrimination was not the law's intent and a bill to change the original law was signed in early April. In the CNN/ORC Poll, most Democrats (70%) and independents (60%) say wedding-related businesses should be required to provide services to same-sex couples as they would different-sex couples, while Republicans break broadly the other way, 67% say religious reasons are a valid justification for refusing service. Full poll results. Looking at Republicans and independents who lean toward the Republican Party, 60% in that group say wedding-related businesses should be allowed to refuse services to same-sex couples, but there are sharp divides within that group by age and ideology. Moderate and liberal Republicans and Republican-leaners broadly say wedding-related businesses should be required to serve all couples the same way (58%) while three-quarters of conservative Republicans favor allowing a caterer or florist to refuse service for religious reasons (74%). Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents under age 50, 56% say wedding-related businesses should be required to serve same-sex and different-sex couples the same way while among those age 50 or older, 72% think they should not be required to do so. The big gay wedding cake quiz. Age differences hold across party lines, but the generation gap among Republicans and Republican-leaners is larger than that among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. Overall, white evangelicals are broadly in favor of allowing businesses to refuse service for religious reasons - 62% say they should be able to. But among whites who are not evangelicals, 61% say such businesses should be required to provide services to all couples the same way. The shift from the Pew Center results comes across demographic lines. Men, women, whites, younger adults and senior citizens all are more apt than in the Pew poll to say wedding-related business should be required to serve same-sex couples as they do others. The CNN/ORC International poll was conducted by telephone, April 16-19, among a random national sample of 1,018 adult Americans. Results for the full poll have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Michigan auto repair shop says yes to gun owners, no to homosexuals.",

Four years have passed since Dmitry Rybolovlev's takeover prompted a slew of big-name arrivals at the Stade Louis II, with the likes of Radamel Falcao, James Rodriguez and Joao Moutinho signed for hefty transfer fees.

Big money signings James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao (right) have left the Stade Louis II. Monaco's new-found financial prudence is beginning to yield results, however, with Les Rouges et Blancs third in Ligue 1 and still in with a chance of qualifying for the semi-finals of European football's premier club competition for the first time in 11 years. The principality club host Juventus at the Stade Louis II on Wednesday looking to overturn a 1-0 deficit from the quarter-final first leg and Jardim, who replaced Claudio Ranieri last June, is proud of what he has achieved in his 10 months at the helm. 'We went from the worst qualified team in the fourth pot, to winning the group, to knocking out a European giant in Arsenal (in the last 16),' he told BeIN Sports' The Ligue 1 Show. 'Right now, you could say that Monaco's coach is very proud of his players. We've shown that we don't need to make big investments to go far in this competition. Dimitar Berbatov is convinced Monaco can reach Champions League semi-final at the expense of Juventus. Monaco are bidding to overturn a 1-0 deficit after defeat in the first leg in Turin last week. Monaco's Belgian midfielder Yannick Ferreira Carrasco arrives fro training. 'The club changed its strategy and the project (in the summer). They have stayed ambitious but the onus was placed more on the development of young players.' Jardim's young guns will have to be on top form if they are to advance to the semi-finals past a Juventus side 15 points clear at the top of the Serie A standings and well poised after Arturo Vidal's spot-kick winner in Turin last Tuesday. Juve are bidding to reach their first Champions League semi-final for 12 years and boss Massimiliano Allegri is taking nothing for granted ahead of Wednesday's encounter. 'The clean sheet at home gives us a slight advantage, even though it won't be straightforward,' he told his club's official website. 'We now know our opposition: they're very well organised in defence and possess technique and physicality in forward areas. Ricardo Carvalho (right), Elderson Echiejile (left) and Alain Traore arrive for training. The Monaco squad warm up for training with a light jog ahead of the quarter-final against Juventus. 'I'm optimistic, even though we know we'll have to put in a good performance and score to reach the next round. They're a complicated side to play against. Monaco don't give you an inch out there.' Monaco will be without striker Lacina Traore and midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko, who are both nursing leg injuries. Juventus are without midfielder Paul Pogba (hamstring) and defender Martin Caceres (ankle). \u00a0.",

        "source": "Britons spend an astonishing \u00a3100 million a year on cough syrup \u2013 when a glass of honey and lemon could work just as well, according to a new BBC television investigation. It claims that branded painkillers that say they specifically treat certain types of pain are just using \u2018clever marketing\u2019 to make patients spend up to ten times more than they would on unbranded products, and that some manufacturers simply use the same pills in different packaging throughout their ranges. Scroll down for video\u00a0. 'Clever marketing': Dr Chris Van Tulleken with a range of packets that, he says, may contain exactly the same pills. The UK over-the-counter medicines market, which also includes painkillers and anti-fungal creams, is worth \u00a32.5 billion, with brands vying for attention with brightly coloured packaging and promises that are questionable under scrutiny, claims Dr Chris Van Tulleken. In The Truth About Medicine, to be broadcast on Thursday, Dr Van Tulleken, an infectious diseases specialist, warns we should think less about convenience and more about the effectiveness of medicines. There are three main types of over-the-counter cough remedies, those that contain suppressants to alleviate symptoms of a dry, tickly cough, syrups that reduce the urge to cough by coating the throat, and products that help to thin sticky mucus, making coughing easier. Some also contain paracetamol or ibuprofen, both of which reduce a temperature, decongestants and antihistamines that can help sleep. Yet an authoritative study from Cardiff University\u2019s Common Cold Centre claimed cough medicines work mostly through a placebo effect, and that just 15 per cent of the effect can be attributed to the medicines in them. PREVENT: Sores on the inside of the mouth or cheeks can be caused by damage to the lining of the mouth from hot foods, biting your cheek or even rubbing dentures. They can also be a sign of an iron or Vitamin B12 deficiency, so a balanced diet can help prevent them. Spicy foods and chocolate can be triggers, so keep a food diary if you have recurrent outbreaks to pinpoint problem foods. It\u2019s also worth checking your toothpaste \u2013 formulas that contain a foaming agent called sodium lauryl sulphate can cause mouth ulcers by reducing the protective mucus layer in the mouth. You might consider switching brands. TREAT: Over-the-counter antiseptic gels can bring relief from the stinging and help form a protective layer around the mouth ulcer to speed up healing. You could also try a medicated mouthwash containing chlorhexidine, which is anti-inflammatory and helps reduce bacteria. If you have had mouth ulcers for more than three weeks, go to your GP or dentist, who may prescribe steroids in the form of a tablet, mouth spray or gel. DON\u2019T BOTHER: Some people believe upping their Vitamin C intake will cure their mouth ulcers, as the vitamin is known to help the wound-healing process, but too much can actually irritate the mouth. Stick to the daily recommended allowance of 40mg per day (30mg for children aged one to ten) through a healthy diet. A study of 60 over-the-counter medicines found that all but two contained sweeteners such as honey or sucrose, which can stimulate saliva and mucus production. In the documentary, Dr Van Tulleken shows how an old-fashioned remedy of honey and lemon could be just the tonic to banish a troublesome cough. He inhales pepper spray into his lungs, which makes him cough, then takes a lemon-and-honey concoction. He inhales the pepper spray once more, but doesn\u2019t cough at all. Professor Alyn Morice of Hull University, who also appears in the programme, admits there is no good scientific answer as to why the home-made cure is as effective but, with no potential side effects, the health benefits are obvious. The Proprietary Association of Great Britain (PAGB), a trade association representing manufacturers of over-the-counter medicines, says that although it is difficult to test the effectiveness of cough medicines, as the severity and duration of symptoms can vary, research has shown they are rated as effective by 90 per cent of consumers. The film also reveals that UK families spend \u00a3350 million on a variety of painkillers, with packaging claiming to specifically target ailments such as period pain, headaches or muscular problems. For example, Nurofen and Feminax both market forms of ibuprofen that are aimed specifically at those suffering from period pain, while Panadol ActiFast, which is a branded form of paracetamol, claims on the packet to treat tension headaches, period pains and toothache. But Dr Van Tulleken says that once the medicine is absorbed into the bloodstream, there is no way to send it to a particular part of the body. He also reveals that different branded packets all have an identical product licence number, which means they look different but contain exactly the same pills. \u2018It isn\u2019t that the manufacturers are being untruthful, but it is clever marketing to tempt you to spend more money,\u2019 said Dr Van Tulleken. The investigation claims branded painkillers that say they specifically treat certain types of pain are just using \u2018clever marketing\u2019 to make patients spend up to ten times more than they would on unbranded products. PAGB chief executive Matthew Speers told this newspaper: \u2018People search for products to treat their specific symptoms, so different labelling and packaging help people navigate the range more easily. \u2018There are different formulations and formats of over-the-counter medicines, which could mean a painkiller gets to work faster or provides pain relief for longer, even if it has the same active ingredient. \u2018For example, migraine products work faster while back pain products tend to be longer-lasting.\u2019. Dr Van Tulleken says: \u2018Some medicines are a waste of our hard-earned cash. Products may be convenient but not necessarily effective.\u2019. Excess production of the skin pigment melanin can cause blotchy uneven patches of darker skin, known as hyperpigmentation or, more commonly, liver spots. Although harmless, they can be unsightly, appearing most commonly on the backs of the hands. Sun damage is a common cause and pregnancy hormones can also trigger the condition. Two recent pregnancies and many years as a sun-worshipper have left me with blotches of darker skin just above my upper lip, on my cheeks and under my eyes. In the winter I cover them with a foundation, but as summer approaches I\u2019d rather not have to cover up with lots of make up. Where\u2019s the solution? The Bliss Labs active 99.0 anti-ageing facial is on offer at their day spa at South Kensington in London. What\u2019s the treatment? The 75-minute facial promises to firm, smooth and reduce the appearance of fine lines as well as helping to reduce the discoloration caused by hyperpigmentation. The therapist begins by cleansing my skin with an exfoliating powder cleanser. She then gets started with the microdermabrasion machine, which works like a mini-hoover to suck up the dead skin cells, and applies a glycolic peel which targets the hyperpigmentation by breaking apart the dead, damaged cells and peeling away the dark marks. After this she applies a serum, which contains kojic acid (this helps to reduce the appearance of dark spots and discoloration and even out the skin tone) and niacinamide, a form of Vitamin B which can even out skin tone. She then uses a wand attached to a micro-current machine to deliver tiny electrical impulses which enhance the penetration of the active ingredients in the serum. The micro-currents also have an anti-ageing effect by increasing blood and lymph circulation and boosting the production of collagen and elastin. The therapist follows up by applying an eye cream to help diminish puffiness and dark circles. She then applies an intensive moisturiser which contains glycolic acid (known to help fade the effects of hyperpigmentation), and finishes off by applying an SPF 30 to the face \u2013 important as microdermabrasion can increase the skin\u2019s photosensitivity for two weeks. Does it work? My skin felt fresher and clearer and its tone was brighter and more even. This was the perfect preparation for scaling down my make up routine as the summer approaches. The blisslabs active 99.0 facial is \u00a3195. To book a treatment, call 020 7590 6146 or visit blissworld.co.uk.",

        "source": "Lord Janner escaped justice after the UK\u2019s top prosecutor over-ruled the advice of two of the country\u2019s most senior QCs, it emerged last night. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders was encouraged by two aides to charge the Labour peer with historic sex crimes. Both Clare Montgomery QC and child abuse expert Eleanor Laws QC, leading counsel to the investigation, offered advice which could have supported a move to prosecute. Scroll down for video\u00a0. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders 'ignored the advice' of to top QCs to charge Lord Janner. Police began investigating Lord Janner, pictured, after allegations of historic child-sex abuse werer made. In particular Mrs Laws pointed to overwhelming evidence and horrific corroborating accounts provided by victims during the exhaustive police inquiry. But Mrs Saunders decided that it was not in the public interest to put Lord Janner in the dock due to his advanced Alzheimer\u2019s, sparking a storm of controversy. The latest revelation came as Mrs Saunders endured a barrage of criticism for ending the case before it could reach court. Campaigners, MPs and victims believe a \u2018trial of the facts\u2019 could have satisfied the need to get the bottom of the appalling claims against Janner whatever his mental state. Figures from across the political spectrum are clamouring for the decision be reversed amid fears of a \u2018whitewash\u2019. Last night, two senior Government figures joined the chorus of disapproval and said the concerns were justified. Clare Montgomery QC, right and Eleanor Laws QC, left, both recommended Janner should face trial\u00a0. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was something \u2018very strange\u2019 about the decision and Health Minster Norman Lamb called for the matter to be settled by the courts. Accusing the CPS of \u2018heinous errors\u2019, Mr Lamb said the authorities should examine precedents of people with dementia being brought to trial. \u2018My concern is that because the DPP and indeed the Crown Prosecution Service at a local level have made errors in this case, heinous errors by failing to bring a prosecution earlier when there was evidence there to do so,\u2019 he said. \u2018This matter should not be concluded by the DPP and should be brought before a court. \u2018There is a precedent of people with dementia being brought to trial. With allegations as serious as this it seems to me that this is the right approach.\u2019. Mr Hunt said Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Theresa May had been \u2018right\u2019 to express concern at the decision. \u2018I think she\u2019s right to do so and I think Boris is right to do so as well because I think we all think that there is something very, very strange here where someone was signing official letters only a matter of weeks ago and is somehow escaping prosecution for something so incredibly serious,\u2019 he said. Meanwhile Lord Carlile, a Lib Dem peer and leading legal expert, said that although there was strong evidence that Lord Janner was suffering from dementia, the decision not to proceed with legal action should be reconsidered. Earlier this week, leading politicians from seven parties came together to attack the latest decision not to prosecute Lord Janner and demand the decision be reversed amid public concerns of a \u2018whitewash\u2019. The cross-party group, led by Labour\u2019s Simon Danczuk, wrote to The Times saying: \u2018As long as justice is not seen to be done and the greater public interest is not served, the public will see attempts to investigate establishment figures involved in historic child abuse as a whitewash.\u2019. Mrs Saunders announced last week that there was enough evidence to charge Janner with 22 crimes against nine victims but said it was not in the public interest to do so. Mrs Saunders\u2019 decision not to prosecute came after a two-year multi-million pound inquiry by Leicestershire Police examining allegations spanning four decades. It led to a furious public row with victims saying they will never see justice and police threatening a High Court legal challenge. Mrs Saunders defended her decision saying it is her duty to make the right judgment even when it is unpopular. But the Daily Mail can reveal Clare Montgomery QC offered advice which could have supported a move to prosecute. Mayor of London Boris Johson, pictured, has expressed concern over the failure to charge Lord Janner. She told Mrs Saunders it was unlikely prosecutors would be \u2018susceptible\u2019 to a judicial review if she took Janner to court. Senior lawyers feared Janner\u2019s legal team, closely advised by his QC son Daniel, would try and block the case with a High Court challenge focusing on his ill health. But Mrs Montgomery is understood to have said that as long as prosecutors had the support of his alleged victims it was unlikely any such review would be successful. Eleanor Laws QC, who was leading counsel to the investigation, recommended that he be charged. Mrs Laws pointed to overwhelming evidence and horrific corroborating accounts provided by victims during the exhaustive police inquiry. Mrs Saunders concluded that there was enough evidence to prosecute but Janner\u2019s ill health prevented any criminal proceedings. She appointed two of the country\u2019s foremost dementia experts who concluded his dementia is at an advanced stage and would never improve. They were Professor Michael Kopelman, of King\u2019s College London, and Dr Katherine Humphreys, of the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. At least 10 men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offences since 2010, including six in the past year. Mrs Saunders has told friends that she has no intention of quitting over the Janner row. One said: \u2018She says she will not be hounded out of office. She is absolutely determined to stay in post.\u2019. In the coming months, she is due to rule on whether Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News UK should face corporate charges over the phone hacking scandal which engulfed the News of the World. Scotland Yard detectives investigating alleged corporate crime are seeking to bring a case that would force senior executives to be held to account. A Crown Prosecution Service spokeswoman confirmed Mrs Laws advised Mrs Saunders to prosecute and said Mrs Montgomery was consulted on an \u2018ancillary matter\u2019. She said: \u2018It is the Director of Public Prosecution\u2019s job to make these extremely difficult decisions, and that is what she has done in this case. \u2018As the ultimate decision maker, she receives advice from a number of internal and external lawyers but the decision is based, ultimately, on her own assessment of the relevant law and circumstances of the case, no one else\u2019s.\u2019.",
        "reference": "Alison Saunders decided against pressing charges against Lord Janner.   She was persuaded against taking a case by the Labour peer's dementia.   Two of Britain's foremost legal experts recommended pressing charges.   Political sources want the decision overturned over 'whitewash' fears \u00a0."

Lorraine Valentine suffers from the rare disease erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) which causes her skin to burn and become unbearable itchy when she is exposed to sunlight or UV light. A holiday abroad left the 42-year-old in hospital for six days, as the heat caused her entire body to swell. Her sun allergy means she has to keep herself completely covered, as even a small dose of sun on her skin leaves her in pain. In summer, everyday tasks like picking her children up from school or going to buy some milk become extremely difficult. Lorraine Valentine, 42,\u00a0calls herself the 'real life vampire' as she has a rare medical condition meaning she is allergic to the sun. Miss Valentine suffers from\u00a0erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) which causes her skin to burn and become unbearable itchy when she is exposed to sunlight. Now, as temperatures in the UK are set to soar, she is desperate for a drug that can help her. Miss Valentine, of Bournemouth, said: 'It's always worst when the sun first comes out because I have no time to adjust. 'I have to pull the curtains closed and have to have a fan on, as any heat is painful.'\u00a0. She was first diagnosed with EPP, a rare blood condition which attacks the liver, when she was nine. The condition \u2013 which is incurable - is caused by a build-up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood. As blood passes through the skin, the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly damage surrounding tissues. The nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain, and it can also cause the tissues to swell up. For Miss Valentine, even tasks like going to the supermarket are painful, as UV light reflects up from the floor, burning her skin. EPP occurs when there is a build-up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood. The skin is more sensitive to longer ultraviolet wavelengths (UVA) and to visible light. It is caused by a shortage of an enzyme in the body that normally converts the protoporphyrin into a substance called haem. As a result of this enzyme deficiency, protoporphyrin levels build up in the blood. As. blood passes through the skin, the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy. from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly. damage surrounding tissues. The. nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain,. and if the blood vessels are affected, they can leak fluid, causing. swelling. The condition is hereditary and symptoms include developing tingling, itching and burning when exposed to sunlight. There is currently no cure. Source: British Skin Foundation. 'From March to November I completely cover up when I'm going to pick up the kids,' she said. 'When it's boiling hot and I'm wearing boots, jeans, a big cardigan, scarf and hat, I do get funny looks off the parents.\u00a0. 'They think I'm a bit strange. 'I try and do normal things and not let it affect me.' Her children. Chloe, 18, Elisha 14, Ben, 12 and Josh, 10, are understanding, but the family lives very close to the beach and so Miss Valentine feels guilty she cannot join them when the weather is good. She said: 'It was difficult for them growing up. 'When I was crying because I was in so much pain, they couldn't even hold my hand.\u00a0. 'The slightest touch puts me in agony.' 'They're understanding, but the beach is just ten minutes away. I should be on the beach with the kids, but I can't. 'I'm just trying not to get sunned on. 'Even driving somewhere, my arm is in pain from the sun coming through the window. 'I don't know what I'll do when it gets even hotter.' In June last year, Miss Valentine decided to take her children on a summer holiday to Lanzarote, as she didn't want them to miss out on this right of passage. She bought special UV protection socks to block out sunlight, and booked an expensive apartment right near the pool. She hoped this would mean she could stay indoors if she needed, but could watch her children enjoy swimming. She found the only way she could enjoy the holiday was to stay indoors, emerging at night to go to the beach and explore the town in the dark. 'We went in June because I thought it would be less hot, but how wrong I was,' she said. Last June, Miss Valentine went on a holiday to Lanzarote but was hospitalised for six days afterwards, as the sun irritated her skin. She must wait until the sun sets before going to the beach near her home (pictured) Miss Valentine, pictured on holiday with her 10-year-old son Josh, said her children are 'understanding' but when she is crying in pain they are unable to hold her hand, as any touch puts her in agony. 'Even though I stayed in the shade, I ended up being covered up and in pain wherever I went. 'I had to borrow a fan to sleep and spent most of the evenings in the toilets of the entertainment area putting cold water on my burning feet. 'The kids would give me the ice from their drinks to put on my feet.' When they flew back a week later, her ordeal wasn't over. She said: 'On the plane I cried, trying to sit there for four hours with the pain of the burns. I was in agony. 'I had the air hostesses get me ice in the end. I was in such pain, I was crying and so upset. 'I went through security and left the kids while I raced to get some cold water and some paper towels to try and ease the pain. Miss Valentine, pictured (left to right) with daughter Chloe, 18, Ben, 12, Josh, 10 and Elisha, 14, is now fundraising for other sufferers of the disease. Five hours later, when the family landed in the UK, Miss Valentine was admitted to hospital. She was kept in for six days as her liver wasn't functioning properly; the condition can cause liver damage in severe cases.\u00a0. Now, she is running the London Marathon for British Porphyria Association to help raise funds for other sufferers of the disease. She is hoping an experimental drug called Scenesse will bring hope for her and other sufferers. The drug acts as an anti-oxidant and activates melanin in skin, providing a barrier between the skin and wavelengths of light that trigger the burning and itching. 'I'll battle for this,' she said. 'I've suffered for so long and been through so much. There needs to be treatment available.' \u00a0.",

A selection of T-shirts (pictured) branded with jokes about stalking has been slammed by The Suzy Lamplugh Trust, a charity which aims to 'make society a safer place' The T-shirts in question are sold in US and UK stores including Zazzle, Look Human and North Shore Shirts. 'Are you stalking me? 'Cause that would be super', reads one, priced at $10.99 (\u00a37.40) in the US. 'I stalk you on Facebook', another states, priced at \u00a316.95 ($25.35). 'Stalking is when Channing Tatum and I go for long romantic walk together but only one of us knows about it', another $28 (\u00a318.90) specimen muses.\u00a0. 'Stalking is such a strong word, I prefer intense research of an individual,' reads a $27 (\u00a318.11) shirt, featuring the description: 'Sometimes when you want to bag a mate you have to do some reconnaissance.' A spokesman from the Suzy Lamplugh Trust told MailOnline that these common slogans seem harmless but they prevent the crime from being taken seriously. She said: 'It does all add to the feeling that it\u2019s something that\u2019s a little bit humorous. It\u2019s not, especially for victims.\u00a0. Making light: According to the SLT, the T-shirts mock a serious issue which affects one in six women, and play into people's fear of being laughed at, which prevents victims from seeking help with stalkers. 'If we're still making jokes about stalking it\u2019s harder for victims to come forward. 'Things are sold with humour but when they\u2019re so commonplace they start to dilute the language around them it starts to become a problem and stalking is a serious offense.\u00a0. 'It doesn\u2019t help that the messages are out there, it just reinforces the myths that are around stalking.' She added: 'Even the language around stalking is potentially damaging, we all talk about stalking people on Facebook but we don\u2019t mean it, we mean we\u2019re looking up someone we went to school with. She said a common view of stalking is that it's romantic, with stalkers leaving bunches of flowers, teddy bears or money on victims' windscreens. 'The behaviours may not seem offensive in that way but if it\u2019s unwanted attention from someone, it\u2019s a problem.' Offending articles: The T-shirts in question are sold in US and UK stores including Zazzle, Look Human (pictured) and North Shore Shirts. In honour of National Stalking Awareness Week, which started on Monday, the personal safety charity, which runs the National Stalking Helpline, has released a two-minute animated film to help shift the public's, at times, blas\u00e9 perspective on the matter. The video's voiceover states: 'What does stalking actually mean? 'It doesn't just mean a stranger ambushing you from the bushes or lurking through the window. 'It can also mean disturbing emails, non-stop phone calls, creepy letters and social media abuse. It means the other person ignores your \"no\". 'It means you're forced to change your life routine for months or even years. 'Oh, and it's not flattering or funny, it's a serious crime. 'So if you're being followed, if there are eyes on you wherever you go, if you are scared to open the door or your mailbox or your text messages, if you jump every time the phone rings, if you haven't had a good night's sleep for a very long time... then this is stalking.' According to the campaign - which seeks to challenge the notion that stalking is 'romantic, trivial or funny' - 80 per cent of victims are women, and more than 80 per cent of men and women combined are stalked by someone they know. Of this, 45 per cent of stalkers are ex-partners, 22 per cent are 'acquaintances', five per cent are colleagues or ex-colleagues, and four per cent are family members. 'It is hard to give an exact definition of stalking because stalkers will often use multiple and differing methods to harass their victims,' the trust explains. Serious crime: 'It is hard to give an exact definition of stalking because stalkers will often use multiple and differing methods to harass their victims,' the SLT explains (picture posed by model) 'Stalking can consist of any type of behaviour, such as regularly sending flowers or gifts, making unwanted or malicious communication (including calls, texts and emails), damaging property and physical or sexual assault. 'If the behaviour is persistent, unwanted and is causing you fear, harassment or anxiety then it is stalking and you should not have to live with it.' The SLT was set up by Diana Lamplugh, the late mother of Suzy, a 25-year-old estate agent who disappeared in Fulham, south west London, in 1986. She was presumed murdered and declared dead in 1993, and no one has ever been charged over her killing. 'Our mission is to campaign, educate and support people to help reduce the risk of violence and aggression for everyone,' the charity states.

        "source": "Charleston, South Carolina (CNN)Police officers Saturday accompanied the hearse carrying the body of Walter Scott to his South Carolina funeral service, where hundreds of mourners celebrated his life and death as a catalyst for change in America. A pair of officers on motorcycles were part of the large procession delivering the father of four -- who was fatally shot in the back by a police officer -- to a service open to the public. An overflow crowd gathered on a humid and occasionally rainy April afternoon at W.O.R.D. Ministries Christian Center in Summerville, which has a capacity of about 300 people. The flag-draped casket of the U.S. Coast Guard veteran was wheeled inside the church as Scott's relatives and friends followed. Some dabbed tears; others embraced. Hundreds, including local officials, assembled inside the packed sanctuary -- in corridors, under an awning at the entrance, wherever they could stand. Silence filled the vast space as Scott's daughter Samantha read a poem of love dedicated to her father. Anthony Scott said God had selected his brother as a candidate for change in America. \"The change will come,\" he said, bringing to the crowd to its feet. The head of the church, George Hamilton, spoke of how Scott had brought members of his family to the church, of the agony of not only losing a family member but having to watch it happen on video. The death of Scott, who was black, at the hands of a white police officer was \"motivated by racial prejudice,\" Hamilton said. It was \"an act of overt racism.\" \"Hate came because Walter was an African-American,\" he said. Hamilton said his remarks were not meant as an indictment of law enforcement, but he singled out the officer who killed Scott as a \"disgrace to the North Charleston Police Department.\" \"There is gong to be change,\" he said. \"Walter's death will not be in vain.\" After the service, pallbearers gently lifted Scott's casket into the hearse. Crowds poured from the church. A slow-moving procession of black cars then made its way to Live Oak Memorial Gardens in Charleston for the private burial. Chris Stewart, an attorney for the Scott family, said the death represented more than an race issue. \"It's a human issue,\" he said. \"We're getting emails from people in Arkansas telling us, 'I'm a white male, and I'm supporting this family.' Their son is going to be remembered for changing the way we look at each other.\" On Friday night, Scott's open casket was draped with an American flag, and he was in a dark suit for his private visitation in Charleston. A Dallas Cowboys banner -- his favorite NFL team -- was placed outside the casket, and a figurine of a Cowboys player stood at his side. But Scott's family was missing. They needed privacy, said Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley, who attended. A week ago, Scott was killed in North Charleston after getting pulled over for a broken taillight. A passer-by caught the shooting on cell phone video, and Officer Michael Slager was swiftly charged with murder. He was fired and faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted. Who was Walter Scott? The video shows Scott running from an officer, who fires eight shots. Scott is struck five times; he falls to the ground. \"Nothing in this video demonstrates that the officer's life or the life of another was threatened,\" National Urban League President Marc Morial said. \"The question here is whether the use of force was excessive.\" But one witness is speaking of a struggle before the shooting. And at least one expert believes a murder charge may not hold up. On Thursday, Gwen Nichols told CNN's Brian Todd that she saw Scott and Slager scuffling at the entrance to a vacant lot. \"It was like a tussle type of thing, like, you know, like, 'What do you want?' or 'What did I do?' type of thing,\" Nichols said. \"I didn't hear Mr. Slager saying 'Stop!' \" Nichols' account has similarities to Slager's. He had told investigators that he had tussled with Scott over his Taser and that he feared for his safety. A timeline of events. Criminal defense attorney Paul Callan said he believes Slager's defense will play up the reported scuffle in arguing that this is not a murder case. \"Defense attorneys will say this was a heat of passion shooting -- (that) this was something that he did suddenly after some kind of an altercation, a physical altercation with a suspect,\" Callan said. \"And that would constitute manslaughter under law, as opposed to murder, and it makes a huge difference in sentencing.\" In South Carolina, a murder conviction requires a measure of premeditation. But the account from the witness who recorded the cell phone video, Feidin Santana, paints a different picture. He was walking to work when he saw Slager on top of Scott, he said, who was on the ground. Santana said he could hear the sound of a Taser in use. He said he didn't see Scott go after the Taser, as Slager initially claimed. He said he believes Scott was trying to get away. \"Mr. Scott never tried to fight,\" Santana said. Neither the struggle nor the use of a Taser was captured on video, because Santana started recording shortly after that. Investigators from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division found troubling inconsistencies from the very start, it said in a statement. \"We believed early on that there was something not right about what happened in that encounter,\" division Chief Mark Keel said in a statement. \"The cell phone video shot by a bystander confirmed our initial suspicions.\" Slager's lawyer, Andy Savage, has complained that he \"has not received the cooperation from law enforcement that the media has.\" Savage's office said in a statement that it has yet to receive \"any investigative documents, audio or video tapes, other than a copy of Mr. Slager's arrest warrant.\" The news release added that the lawyer has been advised that the police union that Slager belongs to \"is no longer involved in the case.\" Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon said Slager's wife, Jamie, who is eight months' pregnant, and his mother had a visit with him at the county detention center Friday. Slager was being held in isolation and being \"monitored for his mental health,\" Cannon said. In a statement, one of Slager's lawyers said the meeting lasted about an hour. \"His wife and mom were tearful but strong, and they were all very grateful for the chance to see him in person, even if separated by a thick pane of glass,\" the statement said. \"They held up family photos -- and even Jamie's ultrasound from earlier that day -- to remind him of all those who love him. Throughout the visit, Michael was focused on Jamie and their baby and was very relieved to know that she is being shown so much love and support by their families.\" A second video, taken from a police dash cam, has also emerged from the day Scott died. It shows moments before the shooting, when things seemed to be going smoothly between Scott and Slager. Scott apparently tells the officer that he has no insurance on the vehicle, and Slager returns to his car to do paperwork. Then Scott gets out of the car and runs out of the camera's frame. Scott was the subject of a bench warrant over $18,104.43 in unpaid child support at the time of the stop, according to court records. That was why he ran, lawyers for the family said after the funeral service. U.S. Rep. James Clyburn, D-South Carolina, told reporters outside the service that Scott lost a $35,000-a-year job the first time he was jailed for failing to pay child support. \"He said it was the best job he's ever had,\" Clyburn said. \"Now you have to ask ... if you want to collect child support, there's got to be income. And you ain't going to make much income from jail. It seems to me that we need to take a look to how to deal with that issue without causing unemployment and the loss of freedom.\" On Friday afternoon, police met with a man who was in Scott's car, but the passenger's name wasn't in a police report obtained by CNN. He was detained briefly after the shooting, one officer wrote in the report. Scott family attorney Chris Stewart said he was a co-worker and friend. But he did not identify the passenger by name. On Friday, a few mourners trickled into the Fielding Home for Funerals. A white banner with a blue star near Scott's casket displayed his favorite NFL team. It said: \"Tradition, the Cowboys way.\" \"This is a heartbreaking tragedy for everyone in our community,\" said Riley, the mayor. \"It breaks everyone's hearts.\" CNN's Polo Sandoval and Martin Savidge reported from Charleston, and Ben Brumfield and Ray Sanchez reported and wrote in Atlanta and New York.",

The official refused to comment on how many such satellites there were, and which countries were operating them. It suggests there could be more satellites than thought monitoring different countries on Earth. The claim was made by the commander of Russian Space Command. Oleg Maidanovich said someone was hiding satellites as space junk (artist's illustration of a satellite shown). But in a film he refused to name the country behind the ruse. The claims were made by the commander of Russian Space Command, Oleg Maidanovich. He was speaking on a film called \u2018Space Special Forces\u2019 during a tour of Russia\u2019s main centre for aerospace intelligence in Krasnoznamensk, near Moscow. \u2018Very recently, specialists of the department of space intelligence centre uncovered a newly created group of space satellites... made for radio-technical reconnaissance of equipment on Russian territory,\u2019 he said. A reconnaissance satellite is unofficially referred to as a spy satellite. They are Earth observation satellites or communications satellites traditionally used for military or intelligence purposes. Some are used to simply take images from the ground, while others relay information from one place to another. Many such satellites are used today for high-resolution photography of certain areas, for scientific or defense purposes.\u00a0. The film goes on to state that there \u2018are cases when a space satellite pretends to be space junk for years and then wakes up and starts working at the right moment.\u2019. The comments were made yesterday on \u2018Space Day\u2019, when Russia commemorated the first human spaceflight - Yuri Gagarin, on 12 April 1961. Since then hundreds of rockets have been launched into space \u2013 and Russia itself now has about 140 satellites operating in orbit. Their Space Command is a division of the military responsible for warning of missile and air strikes and controlling Russia's defence satellites. It monitors about 20,000 objects orbiting the planet, out of a total of 100,000 significant objects. Some objects are believed to have a military purpose - but it\u2019s not quite clear what the purpose of the satellites disguised as space junk are. MailOnline has asked the Russian space agency (Roscosmos) and Space Command for further information on the claim. The comments were made yesterday on \u2018Space Day\u2019, when Russia commemorated the first human spaceflight - Yuri Gagarin (pictured), on 12 April 1961.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO\u00a0. Henthorn was charged with the murder of Toni Bertolet, 51, last November and police have reopened their investigation into the suspicious death of his first wife, Lynn Rishell, some 20 years earlier. Lynn Rishell - Henthorn's first wife - was crushed to death under the front of Henthorn's Jeep when, he told first responders, the jack gave way as she reached under the vehicle for a lug night while changing a flat tire in the dark. In both cases Henthorn was the sole beneficiary of the women's substantial life insurance policies totalling $500,000 in the case of his first wife and $4.5million in the case of his second. Now, newly filed documents have revealed that he is fighting for a $1.5million pay out from the policy taken out in July 2001 on the grounds that he needs the money to pay for his attorney for the forthcoming murder trial scheduled to begin next month. The documents, filed yesterday and seen by Daily Mail Online, are part of a bitter civil case being fought in Douglas County .They note that, just weeks before he is due to stand trial, Henthorn is 'focused solely on his own desire to have the insurance proceeds disbursed to himself without any meaningful process.' They go onto state: 'Should Henthorn truly be able to substantiate an inability to afford counsel in the criminal matter, those matters are properly addressed in the criminal case pending in this District.' They point out: 'The Colorado Supreme Court has said: \"Killers cannot receive life insurance proceeds from their victims\" and insurers cannot disburse proceeds \"prematurely\", \u2026.when law enforcement is still investigating or a prosecution is pending.' The next named beneficiary is his nine-year-old daughter with Dr Bertolet, Hayley. Dr Bertolet died on 29 September, 2012. The autopsy report, dated 18 December 2012, stated that she 'died as the result of multiple blunt force injuries when she fell or was pushed down a cliff while hiking.' It concluded, 'homicide cannot be excluded.' But when her husband submitted a claim for the life insurance death benefit policy almost exactly a year later, on September 27, 2013 he gave her cause of death as 'Accidental Fall.' At the time Henthorn was unaware that he was already the subject of an FBI investigation that lasted two years and scrutinized every aspect of the widower's life, culminating in his arrest last November. But despite facing murder charges Henthorn has not relinquished the claim his claim to the substantial insurance pay out on his wife's death.\u00a0. Shockingly, not only is he fighting for the pay out to fund his own defense, documents filed in a separate motion in March show that he fought his late wife's family to have funds from Dr Bertolet's estate released into his possession. Last February the District Court of Douglas County, Colorado found in Dr Bertolet's family's favor and barred Henthorn from accessing his late wife's estate on the grounds that allowing him to do so posed an 'imminent risk of substantial harm..to [its] financial interests.' Both \u2018freak accidents\u2019 occurred at remote locations with Henthorn the lone witness. Both occurred after about 12 years of marriage and Henthorn, pictured here with his first wife, Rishell, told wildly varying stories about both deaths. Henthorn and Lynn Rishell when he was a new geology graduate from Virginia. The couple moved to Colorado, where after 12 years of marriage, she died in a 'freak accident', now said to be murder. Henthorn (left), pictured with Grace (center) and Lynn (right) Rishell,\u00a0was named as the sole beneficiary in a string of lucrative life insurance policies totaling $500,000 on the death of his first wife and $4.5million on the death of his second after they both died in what appeared to be freak accident. Henthorn attempted to overturn this decision as recently as December and only finally failed when a court denied him access to the funds and demanded that he appoint a forensic accountant to detail the contents of his late wife's estate. In March Daily Mail Online revealed that, in 2009 Henthorn took out a life insurance policy on his former sister-in-law, Grace Rishell. Grace was going through a divorce and 'concerned for her financial stability,' when she initially agreed to Henthorn's suggestion that she take out a policy that would pay $50,000 to Grace's brother and each of her four daughters for a total of $250,000. According to prosecutors in Dr Bertolet's murder case, 'the evidence will show that Henthorn had a romantic interest in Rishell.' But she had a change of heart in spring 2010 and told the insurance agent to stop the policy from going through. Instead she took out a policy of her own with another insurer. Yet unbeknownst to her, 'her signature was forged to procure the original policy as well,' with Henthorn making payments on the policy until December 2012 and listing himself as the sole beneficiary. The policy was cancelled in 2013 when the insurer concluded that Henthorn had no insurable interest in RIshell. But the very fact of its existence raises the specter that Henthorn had Rishell in his sights as a third potential victim. Henthorn was denied bail by US District Attorney Judge Kathleen Latoyfa who described him as a 'danger' and said, 'there are rather glaring similarities between the loss of his first wife and the loss of his second.' She pointed to large sums of money recently transferred by Henthorn to his brother as suggestive that he was 'hiding funds.' Henthorn's trial is scheduled to begin in September. He has entered a plea of not guilty. \u00a0.",

        "source": "Ever had a headache so big, you felt like drilling a hole in your head to let the pain out? In Neolithic times trepanation -- or drilling a hole into the skull -- was thought to be a cure for everything from epilepsy to migraines. It could even have been a form of emergency surgery for battle wounds. But while there is still conjecture about the real reasons behind the mysterious procedure, what is known is that the implement often used to carry out the primitive surgery was made from one of the sharpest substances found in nature -- obsidian. Obsidian -- a type of volcanic glass -- can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels. At 30 angstroms -- a unit of measurement equal to one hundred millionth of a centimeter -- an obsidian scalpel can rival diamond in the fineness of its edge. When you consider that most household razor blades are 300-600 angstroms, obsidian can still cut it with the sharpest materials nano-technology can produce. Even today, a small number of surgeons are using an ancient technology to carry out fine incisions that they say heal with minimal scarring. Dr. Lee Green, professor and chair of the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Alberta, says he routinely uses obsidian blades. \"The biggest advantage with obsidian is that it is the sharpest edge there is, it causes very little trauma to tissue, it heals faster and more importantly it heals with less scarring,\" he said. \"It makes for the best cosmetic outcome.\" He explained that steel scalpels at a microscopic level have a rough cutting edge that tears into tissue, a function of the crystals that make up the metal. Obsidian, meanwhile, cleaves into a fine and continuous edge when properly cut. Dr. Green said he once helped documentary makers produce a program on surgical technology in ancient Egyptian, setting up a blind test on the cutting power of obsidian. Using cultured-skin burn dressing, a substance composed of skin cells, he made an incision with a modern scalpel and a parallel incision with an obsidian scalpel. The host of the program was then invited to look at the cuts under a video microscope and tell the difference. \"It wasn't hard to tell the difference at all -- as soon as he turned around everyone in the studio was like 'Ohhh',\" Dr. Green said. \"Under the microscope you could see the obsidian scalpel had divided individual cells in half, and next to it the steel scalpel incision looked like it had been made by a chainsaw.\" Modern obsidian scalpels look nothing like the decorative flint-knapped knives of Neolithic man, often resembling their modern counterparts in everything except for the blade edge, but Dr. Green said they are a very different animal. \"The feel is very different because obsidian has no 'bite,'\" he said. \"If you look under the microscope at a steel scalpel edge it looks almost like a saw, it has teeth, whereas obsidian is smooth even microscopically. \"It's a very different feel to work with and you have to practice before you start using it in surgery. \"You also have to be careful not to nick yourself with it because you don't even feel it!\" And Dr. Green believes incisions made with these blades heal faster. He said a colleague who needed a mole removed agreed to undergo an experiment where half the procedure was carried out with an obsidian scalpel and the other half was removed with steel. \"What's really fun is seeing it heal,\" he said. \"Four weeks later the difference was quite remarkable -- there was very much a difference in scarring.\" In Germany, the manufacturer Fine Science Tools produces obsidian scalpels which can be used in situations where the patient may have an allergy to steel or metal. \"For studies where trace metals from ordinary scalpel blades cannot be tolerated, these very special obsidian scalpels may provide the answer,\" the company says. At \u20ac99 per scalpel ($107.40), they represent a considerable saving on their diamond cousins which the company prices at \u20ac712.50 ($772.60). But there has been little academic research into the efficacy of obsidian blades compared to steel scalpels, and they do have disadvantages: Obsidian scalpels are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, and they are extremely brittle and prone to breaking if lateral forces are applied -- meaning they are unlikely to ever be in widespread use. Dr. Green, whose scalpels were manufactured for him by an expert flint-knapper and archaeologist Errett Callahan, concedes the Stone Age scalpels are not for everyone. \"If it was let loose on the market there'd be far too many injuries from it,\" he said. \"It's very fragile and it's very easy to break pieces off.\"",

Dave Sim has put in months of training aboard his bright yellow Mark Three Chopper in preparation to ride all 2077 miles of the 2015 Tour de France route this summer. The 36-year-old personal trainer from Southport, Merseyside, is hoping his stunt will inspire people to get out and ride themselves. Scroll down for video\u00a0. Dave Sim, 36, rides his Raleigh Chopper on the L'Etape du Tour last year. He now hopes to cycle the entire Tour de France. The tour involves many hill climbs which are grueling even for professionals using high-performance road bikes. Mr Sim and two others, who are using proper road bikes, attempt a hill climb in France last year. Mr Sim said his Chopper is as close to standard as possible, but required a better seat and tweaked brakes. Mr Sim said his Chopper - the 2004 revival of the iconic 1970's children's bike - is as close to standard as possible. He said: 'I've tried to make as few changes as possible so it's got the original tyres. 'The main thing I've changed is the seat post and the pedal arms as it was originally designed for kids. 'And the wheels - on the first part of the race through Northern France, there are a lot of sections of really terrible cobbles, so a guy made me some really strong wheels as I kept breaking spokes. 'I've also had to put slightly better brakes on as well. 'Up the biggest climbs it gets a bit grim, it was just two degrees at the top of one, the Col de Tourmalet - it took me forever to get down, I was almost hypothermic at the bottom.' While it's by far the longest ride he's attempted, Mr Sim has completed long rides on the Chopper before. Mr Sim attempted the L'Etape du Tour on the Raleigh Chopper last year and finished in the top 20 per cent. Mr Sim hopes his audacious attempt to ride the Tour de France will inspire others to take up cycling. Pictured left, Mr Sim stands with others riding the L'Etape du Tour. Right, he is pictured with his Chopper in the Lake District. He said: 'I did the L'Etape du Tour last year it's a mass start event where thousands do a stage of the Tour de France on closed roads. 'Lots of people didn't think I could do it, but I thought, why not have a go? 'I did really well, got a really good time, I was in the top 20 per cent, so the next morning, I thought about doing the full tour. 'I thought, if I could do one day, is it possible to do the whole tour? 'After the Etape I shouldn't have wanted to even see a Chopper again, but it was a bit of a Eureka moment, that's where it came from. 'I come from a cycling family, my mum and dad would take me to see the Tour, riding up mountains is in my blood. 'It's always been a bit of a dream to ride the Tour de France, I won't do it again, my dad said he never would have thought I'd do it on a chopper!' He said: 'Part of the motivation was to show people you don't need a \u00a310,000 bike to do amazing things on - my bike cost me \u00a3100, and I'm doing the Tour on it. With a bike, it's mostly to do with the engine. 'In the last five years the cost of road cycling has sky rocketed but you don't need all that, you just need to get out and ride. 'The other side of the challenge is to raise as much money for Help for Heroes as possible.' Mr Sim also hopes his stunt will raise as much money as possible for charity Help for Heroes. \u00a0.",

The rescue unfolded last Wednesday when a neighbour heard miaowing coming from the side of his garage.

Firefighters spent half an hour chiselling a breezeblock free from the neighbour's wall, revealing Marv's tail and back legs so Mr Coombs could pull him out backwards. Firefighters were then called and they were forced to chisel through the wall in order to free Marv, who was stuck.

Marv the cat became stuck in a small gap in between two garages next to his owner's house in Hanham, Bristol\u00a0. He said: 'We don't know how Marv got into the space, it may be that he fell into the gap and struggled to get free only to get himself well and truly stuck. 'As usual, we are immensely grateful to the fire and rescue service for their help, not to mention grateful to the neighbour, whose garage wall came off the worst in this incident! 'It was great to see Marv reunited with his family after this real team effort to free him.' While owner Mr Veale, a mortgage broker, added: 'My neighbour came round to tell me he thought the cat was stuck. 'He was crying out quite a bit and he was too far stuck down to get out, and also upside down, so he couldn't hold on to anything. He was eventually reunited with his owner's daughters Tilly and Bella and luckily he was uninjured\u00a0.

I'm in the process of trying to fix the hole in his garage.' 'Marv does like to get into things, but this is definitely the smallest space he's managed to squeeze into.

'He can name virtually every player in that period, despite having spent 30 of those years in The Rolling Stones. 'Bill Wyman is not only a charming man but also somebody with a genuine passion for the game and its traditions. Wyman (back right) with fellow members of The Rolling Stones back in 1964. 'Given Bill\u2019s rock-star status, Steve Parish overlooked his normally strict rule that you must wear a shirt and tie in the boardroom.' Hodgson, who was a youth team player for Palace in the 1960s and is from the area, will have been casting his eye over a host of English players. Pardew used seven Englishmen including matchwinner Jason Puncheon, while England No 1 Joe Hart and utility man James Milner both played for City.

After losing by the same scoreline on Easter Monday, Aitor Karanka's kept their automatic promotion hopes alive with their 14th home win of the season thanks to second-half goals by Lee Tomlin and Patrick Bamford, who also missed a late penalty. But with the top three sides all winning, Boro stayed fourth in the Sky Bet Championship table. Lee Tomlin (centre) scored the opening goal in Middlesbrough's 2-0 win at home to Rotherham on Saturday. Tomlin (centre) is mobbed by his Middlesbrough team-mates after his fine solo effort gives them the lead. Middlesbrough: Konstantopoulos, Kalas, Gibson, Ayala (Woodgate, 70), Friend, Clayton (Whitehead, 79), Forshaw, Adomah, Tomlin (Nsue Lopez, 85), \u00a0Bamford, Garcia Martinez. Subs not used:\u00a0Ripley, Vossen, Amorebieta, Wildschut. Goals:\u00a0Tomlin 50, Bamford 66.

Booked: Arnason, Frecklington. Referee: Iain Williamson. Attendance: 19,537. After a quiet start, Boro soon started to find their feet and when Rotherham failed to clear a corner in the 10th minute, returning defender Daniel Ayala tried an ambitious bicycle kick which went straight into Emiliano Martinez's hands. The home side dominated the first half and on the half-hour they had two bites at the cherry. First Ayala's header was cleared off the line before Tomlin's follow-up shot was blocked. It was Albert Adomah's turn to have a pop three minutes later when he shot from just inside the area, but Martinez did well to get down to it, and he was also denied by Danny Lafferty on the line minutes later. The opening goal came five minutes into the second half when Tomlin pressed forward and the Millers defenders stood off the forward, allowing him time and space to plant a low shot past Martinez. The United keeper had to be on his toes again five minutes after the goal when Kike played a smart ball in behind the defence for Bamford, but Martinez did well to smother the ball at his feet. Kike had a shot saved on the hour before Bamford doubled Boro's lead six minutes later with his 16th goal of the season. Tomlin laid the ball off for the Chelsea forward and he took one touch before coolly rolling the ball past Martinez into the bottom corner. Rotherham had a rare shot at goal after 73 minutes when substitute Lee Frecklington hit a powerful drive which had Dimi Konstantopoulos beaten but it flew past his post. Patrick Bamford (left) doubled the Teesiders' lead on 66 minutes with a cool left-footed finish. The 21-year-old celebrates his strike, taking his personal tally to 16 league goals this season so far. But it was Boro who looked like the only side capable of scoring and the third nearly came in the 77th minute when Tomlin clipped an exquisite ball to the back post but Bamford's first-time half-volley was easily saved by Martinez at his near post. Sub Emilio Nsue should have made it three with two minutes to go when he had an open goal but his shot was deflected just wide. And from the resulting corner Kike met Adam Forshaw's ball with a thumping header which Martinez had to tip over the bar. Bamford should have bagged his 17th goal of the season when Richard Wood brought Kike down in the area, but the forward's poor spot-kick was saved by Martinez. However, the on loan Chelsea star failed to add to his tally late on when he saw his penalty saved.",
        "reference": "Lee Tomlin's superb solo effort gave Middlesbrough a 50th minute lead\u00a0.   Patrick Bamford doubled the hosts lead on 66 minutes\u00a0.   Bamford could have made it 3-0 but saw his penalty saved late on.   Win moves Middlesbrough on to 78 points in the Championship in fourth."

The firm said it made the changes after noticing many users put their Instagram user name in their profile.\u00a0. 'Now there\u2019s no need to put your Instagram handle in your profile description to tell your story (we got sick of having to do that, too).' It also stressed that the app would not let other visitors to your Instagram feed know it was part of a dating profile. 'And in case you were wondering, Tinder won\u2019t post anything to Instagram on your behalf or alter your existing Instagram privacy settings.' Tinder has overhauled its profile as part of the Instagram integration - and now shows friends of friends as well as more interests. The firm has also used Facebook to boost its 'mutual friends' feature. Tinder now shows you the mutual friends and friends of friends you have in common with your potential matches. 'This adds more context and an extra degree of connection to every swipe,' Tinder claims.\u00a0. It is also preparing an overhaul of the way profiles look, expanding the number of interests people can add.\u00a0. Earlier this month Tinder rolled out \u2018Tinder Plus\u2019, a premium service allowing people to \u2018undo\u2019 a like or change their location. A study has found that nearly two thirds of dating app users are men - and one in five will pay for premium services. Sixteen to 34 year-olds make up the majority of mobile dating app users, accounting for 70 per cent of the total user base. The study, carried out by London-based research firm GlobalWebIndex, also found that six per cent of web users currently use a location-based dating app. Significantly, just a fifth of dating app users are paying for an online dating service,' co-authors Jason Mander and Felim McGrath said in the report. But now they have set a limit on the number of \u2018likes\u2019 a user can perform in one day - which seems to be set at 100.\u00a0. When a user reaches this limit, the app tells them \u2018You\u2019re Out of Likes\u2019, and gives a countdown clock until 24 hours are up so they can start swiping again. But, below this clock, a big red button says \u2018Get Unlimited Likes with Tinder Plus\u2019. A price is then shown. But different users are reporting the app is asking for different amounts. It seems the prices range from around \u00a31.49 a month to as high as \u00a314.99 - but the reasons why are not clear. This means some users will pay \u00a317.88 a year for Tinder Plus - but others, in the upper price category, will have to fork out a whopping \u00a3179.88 a year. This equates to some users inadvertently paying \u00a3162 more than others over the course of a year. Speaking to MailOnline, Rosette Pambakian, Vice President of Communications and Branding at Tinder, told MailOnline the app is testing out different price points ahead of a global release. 'We are testing Tinder Plus in select markets at various price points before rolling it out globally,' she said. 'The UK is one of our test markets, so a certain portion of the population was given access to Tinder Plus at varying price points.' However, it is still not clear how the app decides how much to charge a user - and whether it is based on location or activity. In addition, Tinder has not commented on whether a user will receive a refund if they ultimately paid over the odds for the final price of the service. \u00a0. \u00a0.",

The amazing images reveal a kaleidoscope of colours in icy caves - lit up by flares and fire-breathing (Denis Budkov pictured) 'It was pretty cold and wet inside and the water was flowing down from the roof and walls,' he said. \u2018It was zero degrees inside, too, and the lens was getting damp - making it hard to shoot. \u2018But when I got deeper inside the caves, I was amazed by the colours I saw. I haven't seen anything like this before. \u2018The emerald colours of the ice were spectacular, and worth the risk of the roof caving in to capture the pictures.\u2019. On the left is the location of the caves, and on the right is a picture of photographer\u00a0Denis Budkov. Mr Budkov, 35, trekked inside the dangerous caves - which could collapse at any moment - to capture the colourful scenes. The extensive caves, some parts of which have water in them, were first discovered by Mr Budkov by chance. The ice cave's unique formations are created by the heavy winter snow becoming compressed and forming ice. Then as the short, summer months arrive, intensive melting of the ice creates ravines which flow and hollow out the caves and tunnels. The incredible lights shining purple, blue, green and yellow are no computer trickery - they are the result of sunlight streaming through the glacial ice into the hidden world below. The cave was carved out of the glacier by an underground river that is sourced in a hot spring gushing from the Mutnovsky volcano itself.

Since Monday, over-55s have been able to withdraw all or part of their pension pots instead of being forced to buy a regular pension income for life, known as an annuity. The Government had said that everyone over the age of 55 who wanted to take part in the new pension freedoms would be given a free half-hour session of guidance but just 300 advisers are available (file picture) But one major provider reported that customers in their 20s had been calling up to withdraw their retirement savings \u2013 unaware they were three decades too young. Others were unaware they faced a hefty tax bill if they removed all their cash at once. The confusion was not helped by a decision to pull the plug on television adverts promoting the Government's pensions helpline. The Treasury said that, ahead of the election, it had switched to a 'low level' advertising campaign for its Pension Wise guidance service and dropped its television adverts for almost two months. 'Purdah' rules bar Government advertising campaigns before a general election so that it does not promote the cause of a certain political party. But experts said barring TV adverts which raise awareness of the pension changes would punish consumers, some of whom were already confused by the changes. Experts fear pensioners could be vulnerable if they do not receive proper advice regarding pension plans now that over-55s can\u00a0cash in their pensions and spend them \u00a0instead of being forced to buy an annuity (file image) David Trenner, of Intelligent Pensions, said it was 'crazy to stop advertising Pension Wise under Purdah rules', while Catriona Standingford, who runs a financial training firm, asked on Twitter: Shouldn't the consumer/taxpayer come first?.' The Treasury said the service will only be advertised through print and digital advertising for April and most of May. Pensions firm Fidelity Worldwide Investment said it had taken 1,300 calls about the pension freedoms in the last week alone. But several calls a day have been from people under-55 trying to access their cash, including a 23-year-old who mistakenly believed they could 'get hold of their pot now'. Richard Parkin, of Fidelity, said: 'Misunderstandings exist around when you can access your funds. 'Since the new freedoms were announced, we've received a steady number of calls from people under the age of 55 who think they can access their funds under the new rules.' \u00a0.",

        "source": "Tony Fernandes spoke of his despair after his Queens Park Rangers team twice threw away a lead against Aston Villa, with the Rangers chairman watching the scenes at Villa Park from afar on his iPhone. Christian Benteke's hat-trick earned a draw for Villa, with his last goal coming just seven minutes before full-time, and within five minutes of what had looked like a winner from Charlie Austin. Matt Phillips had earlier given QPR the lead in the first half but taking all three points wasn't to be for the relegation-threatened visitors and they had to settle for a point at Villa Park. Tony Fernandes spoke of his despair after his Queens Park Rangers team twice threw away a lead. Fernandes, Rangers chairman, was watching the 3-3 draw at Villa Park from his iPhone away from the game. Taking all three points wasn't to be for the relegation-threatened visitors and they had to settle for a point. And Fernandes, currently in Malaysia, spoke of his experience of a variety of emotions while watching the game from the other side of the world. 'It's a strange thing thus QPR love,' he tweeted. 'I went to bed at 1 in the morning. I got up exactly at 2.45 am. No alarm. My heart knew it's QPR time.\u00a0. 'I watched the game on my iPhone all kinds of emotions. Despair, disappointment, joy, but most important pride. 4 points from two away games.' Fernandes revealed that Richard Dunne and Leroy Fer could return for Sunday's visit of Chelsea and that Yun Suk-young would also return after that game. The character of QPR's Clint Hill and Chris Ramsey were praised by their club's chairman on Twitter. Charlie Austin looked like he might have scored a late winner for QPR but Christian Benteke equalised. Clint Hill scored his first Barclays Premier League goal for Rangers' second, and Fernandes was delighted with the display of the veteran centre back, even if he did fail to get to grips with the prolific Benteke. He also reserved praise for manager Chris Ramsey. 'Clint hill typified our fighting spirit,' he posted. 'As I've always said players playing for the badge and Chris Ramsey what a pro.' Finally, Fernandes posted some cryptic tweets as to his own future at the club, perhaps hinting that he would be leaving. Hill had equalised in the second half after hosts Villa led 2-1 at the break courtesy of Benteke's two goals. Matt Phillips opened the scoring for Rangers but they found themselves pegged back by brilliant Benteke. Fernandes is also Global CEO of AirAsia, the airline that saw\u00a0flight QZ8501 go missing late last year. 'It's been a tough three months since December 28th. Abuse, tragedy, close friends gone but I never stopped believing in all that we do,' Fernandes said. 'The decision on my future has been made. 6 games 18 points. Never stop believing rangers fans. Les also a hero. Never stop believing.'\u00a0. QPR stay inside the relegation zone but moved up to 18th place with the draw. They face Chelsea at Loftus Road on Sunday in what is sure to be another occasion to play on supporters', and the owners', emotions.\u00a0.",

        "source": "Judd Trump was in confident mood after safely moving through to the second round of the Betfred World Championship in Sheffield. Trump led 7-2 overnight and many thought he would make light work of Stuart Carrington but he was made to battle before eventually securing a 10-6 victory. The 25-year-old closed with a century and will now face Marco Fu in the next round. Judd Trump beat Stuart Carrington 10-6 on Thursday in the first round of the World Championship. 'I'm just going to focus on my own game,' he told BBC Two. 'If I play how I know I can, I'll win it.' A re-rack was required in the 10th frame but that did not distract Carrington who produced a break of 97 to reduce the gap to four. Trump took the next with a streak of 74 but a 74 of his own from Carrington followed by a run of 70 in the next meant it was 8-5 at the interval. Carrington got amongst the balls after the interval but was halted at 24 and Trump swept in with a 76 to move within one frame of victory. Grimsby potter Carrington showed his mettle, though, with a 99 in the next before a closing 109 from Trump put an end to his campaign. And the 2011 finalist was quick to praise his opponent, who was making his Crucible debut. Trump (pictured) led 7-2 from Wednesday and got the job done despite a good display by Carrington. 'He played really well considering it's his first time here,' he said. 'Second session he hardly missed a ball. He probably won't take as much credit as he would if it was a top player making those breaks. 'He played as good as anyone I've seen first time here.' Trump is one of the crowd favourites wherever he plays and admits there is a weight of expectation on him this year. 'There's obviously a lot of anticipation this year,' he added. 'My results have shown that I'm playing some good stuff, I felt like I played well over the past two days. 'There's obviously a few things I need to work on but other than that I feel very confident. 'It was nice for Stuart to play as he did, it just shows there is always stuff to work on and you won't get many sessions where someone plays that well.' After being five frames behind, Carrington closed the gap to three before Trump earned the victory. At the press conference following his win, Trump was asked about the footwear problems encountered by long-time rival Ronnie O'Sullivan, whose 10-3 victory over Craig Steadman required a change of shoes. Having started Tuesday's match in a new pair of shoes, O'Sullivan discarded them due to the acute discomfort they were causing him; he briefly played in socks before accepting tournament director Mike Ganley's shoes which 'felt great' to him. Of the incident, Trump said: 'I didn't really see it but I heard about it. Obviously, he likes attention. I don't know if he's done it on purpose or not, who knows?' As to the overall favourite for the World Championship, Trump was quick to divert attention away from O'Sullivan, adding: 'In my eyes, I think Neil's (Robertson) probably the underdog,. Ronnie O'Sullivan was forced into borrowing a pair of shoes from\u00a0tournament director Mike Ganley. 'I think Neil's favourite to win the tournament. Neil and Mark (Selby) are going to be the toughest two. Ronnie is obviously a good player but I'm confident of beating anyone.' On the other table, defending champion Mark Selby was locked in a tough battle with Anthony McGill in the opening second round match. Selby, who needed to scrap for a 10-9 win over Kurt Maflin in the first round, got off to a slow start as he surrendered the first two frames. The first was a scrappy encounter but a break of 63 sealed the second for McGill before runs of 51 and 46 saw Selby on the board. The Leicester cueman then levelled things up at the mid-session interval with a 65 and an 87 at the third time of asking saw him edge ahead. Defending champion Mark Selby closed the session at 4-4 with\u00a0Anthony McGill in their second round match. McGill was not daunted, though, and breaks of 74 and 73 in the next two saw him take a 4-3 lead before Selby drew level again to end the session at 4-4.\u00a0\u00a0. Shaun Murphy, the 2005 world champion and current Masters title holder, conceded just the one additional frame to his overnight lead of 7-2 as he wrapped up a 10-3 win over Robin Hull. Murphy's first frame on Thursday was a tight affair at 56-55 and he went on to win the next 64-33. Finland's Hull was able to pick up frame 12 but Murphy's wrapped up the contest with a break of 111. It sealed his passage to the second round where he will meet Joe Perry, who had beaten Zhang Anda 10-4. Shaun Murphy wrapped up victory against Finland's Robin Hull with a 10-3 win on Thursday. Ding Junhui has a chance of progressing past John Higgins after his break of 94 sealed frame eight to leave the Chinese 5-3 down going into Friday's session. Higgins had picked up back-to-back frames at the start without much fuss, including 81 on the first, though Ding's class showed in a 135 break in the third. Four-time World Championship winner Higgins then threatened to walk away with the match by winning three frames on the bounce, starting with 116-6 in the fourth and going on to lead 5-1. However, Ding fought back in the closing stages to narrow the deficit, though he did miss out on a second century break of the match after failing to pot the black, on what was to prove the last shot of the day.",

Trusting society, having a government that ranks on low in corruption, a society where people are generous and volunteering -- all of these are important for happiness.\" Even if you don't live in one of the 10 happiest countries in the world, a visit to these happy places will give you a taste of what the locals enjoy every day. Here are the top 10 happiest places on Earth, according to the World Happiness Report. 1. Switzerland. Switzerland took the top spot from Denmark in 2015, rising from third to first place in this year's list of the world's happiest countries. Bern, the capital city of Switzerland, has the cobblestone streets and medieval architecture that make it apparent why the old city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Since the city's founding in the 12th century, it has expanded in an often neat and orderly fashion. And the lovely River Aare offers in-town swimming and boating. Looking to get out of the capital city? Book a trip to Lucerne, where you can take a boat trip on the lake, ride the panorama gondola, take in the views on the new Dragon Ride aerial cableway and ride on the world's steepest cog railway. Book the Golden Round trip and get all four trips -- and stunning views of the Alps -- in one day. (The railway reopens in mid-May.) And no matter where you go, there will certainly be plenty of delicious chocolate to try. 2. Iceland. Nature and culture combine to make Iceland a truly happy place, so delightful that the tiny country jumped from ninth to second place this year. Explore South Iceland, where many of the ancient tales -- called sagas -- that document Iceland's 10th- and 11th-century history are remembered. A two-hour drive from the capital city of Reykjavik, south Iceland is home to Vatnajokull Glacier, the 60-meter (197-foot) Skogafoss Waterfall and amazing fresh seafood. (Though you could probably skip the fermented shark ...) No matter where you visit, there's probably a geothermal swimming pool or hot spring spa to soak your weary bones after a long day of exploring. And when you get back to the capital, note that the renowned annual Reykjavik Art Festival will take place from May 17 through June 7. 3. Denmark. Never mind that Denmark lost the top spot this year and is now the third-happiest country in the world. Looking at all that Danes have to be happy about, you won't notice the slight dip while you're enjoying jazz at the Copenhagen Jazz Festival in July, hanging out with the hipsters at Queen Louise's Bridge, taking a canal tour or playing beach volleyball in front of the Royal Danish Playhouse. Prefer your music in the woods? Head to Smuk Fest (\"The Beautiful Festival\"), a rock/pop festival in the woods of Skanderborg held in August. Wherever you go, enjoy that Danish tradition of \"hygge,\" sometimes translated too simply as the need for \"coziness.\" It's really a complex sense of intimacy, community and contentment that generally happens with friends and family, and it makes for one happy country.

The sun never sets in some parts of Norway during the summer months, and the North Cape area is one of the best spots to play when the sun stays out for 24 hours. Visitors love to golf, hike and even run a marathon during the months ruled by the midnight sun. If your taste buds dictate your travels, head to the Norwegian capital city of Oslo, a gastronomic paradise where the Michelin food guide has awarded five stars among four restaurants: Ylajali, Statholdergaarden and Fauna (one star each) and Maeemo (two stars). 5. Canada. Canada combines European style, sensibility and history with the enormous natural wonder of North America. Within the French-speaking province of Quebec, a tour through the historic city of Old Quebec is a treat for any Francophile. Founded in the early 17th century, it's the only North American city north of Mexico that still has its fortifications. The historic district is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Just a few minutes from downtown Quebec City, Ile d'Orleans is a small island where farming and agriculture are still a way of life. And if nature is what you crave, in less an hour from Qu\u00e9bec City, you could be hiking through the Parc national de la Jacques-Cartier, home to the glacial Vall\u00e9e de la Jacques-Cartier. 50 states, 50 spots to get happy around the U.S. 6. Finland. What a happy event to spot the rare Saimaa ringed seal, which adapted to freshwater living after the Ice Age cut off its lake home from the sea. There are only about 300 of them in the world, and they can be found at Lake Saimaa in eastern Finland. But you might have more luck spotting the white whooper swan, Finland's national bird, whose arrival heralds the start of spring. For a more urban experience, visit Helsinki's Market Square and Museum of Contemporary Art Kiasma. And you can still spot animals in the capital city: In mid-May, the cows will be herded into the fields in Viikki, a neighborhood in Helsinki, after the long winter. Locals always gather to celebrate this moo-ving event. 7. Netherlands (Holland) Though the Netherlands' tulips are without equal, and they are most stunning at Keukenhof (known as the Garden of Europe), there are so many beautiful spots across the country to walk and bike to welcome spring and its trademark flower. For a more regal celebration, note that the kingdom celebrates its 200th year this year with many festivities. 8. Sweden. In a country that's very fond of celebration, Swedes love to celebrate midsummer, the longest day of the year, most of all. It's a national holiday marked with traditional food and dances around a maypole. Can't make the midsummer parties? There's still plenty to do. Just 20 minutes from the capital city of Stockholm, the Stockholm Archipelago of about 30,000 islands offers endless opportunities for contentment. Swimming, hiking, cycling, fishing, horseback riding -- it's all within your reach by booking a boat ride. (Some boat trips include meals and tours of many of the islands.) 9. New Zealand. New to the top 10 list of happiest countries, New Zealand has plenty of reasons to celebrate. Though it's always been an attractive spot to explore, Peter Jackson choosing the country to host the filming of the \"Lord of the Rings\" movie trilogy has given New Zealand more attention than money could buy. The capital city of Wellington has benefited from the growth of the movie industry, developing a happening restaurant and design scene. And many of the country's natural wonders have gained international attention, including the 2,291-meter (7,516-foot)-high Mount Ngauruhoe, which played the fictional Mount Doom. It's part of Tongariro National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 10. Australia. The Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest collection of coral reefs, is a natural phenomenon not to be missed. Australians are arguing fiercely over manmade threats to its existence (and no one is happy about that). Once you've had a chance to explore that magical underwater realm, head to the Australian state of Tasmania, an island 240 kilometers (149 miles) off the mainland coast. The Tasmanian Wilderness, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, includes one of the last surviving temperate rainforests in the world. To see the wilderness up close, try hiking the stunning 65-kilometer (40-mile) Overland Track. It takes about six days for hikers (who must book the trip in advance), but day-trippers can take short hikes starting at Cradle Mountain Visitor Centre and Dove Lake.",

A grieving daughter has come up with an unusual way to keep the memory of loved ones alive - by bottling their scent. Seven years ago, Katia Apalategui's mother coped with losing her husband by holding on to his pillowcase which his smell clung to. This inspired the 52-year-old French insurance saleswoman to think of a more permanent way to capture a person's individual scent in a bid to help others in mourning.\u00a0.

But the 'made-to-measure' perfumes will be rather costly and be priced at around 560 euros (\u00a3400). To help develop her idea, she teamed up with the Havre university in France, where researchers have developed a technique to reproduce the human smell. The university's Geraldine Savary explained the process involved taking a person's clothes and extracting the odour - a few hundred characteristic molecules - which is then made into a bottle of perfume in four days. She said: 'There was a perfect synergy between what she wanted to do and what our researchers are doing so we decided to get involved. 'There is a very strong link between memory and smell which is similar to that between the memories we have from looking at old photos, videos and other things. 'We take the person's clothing and extract the odour, which represents about a hundred molecules, and we reconstruct it in the form of a perfume in four days.' She came up with a more permanent way to capture a person's individual scent in a bid to help others in mourning. File photo.

        "source": "James Holmes made his introduction to the world in a Colorado cinema filled with spectators watching a midnight showing of the new Batman movie, \"The Dark Knight Rises,\" in June 2012. The moment became one of the deadliest shootings in U.S. history. Holmes is accused of opening fire on the crowd, killing 12 people and injuring or maiming 70 others in Aurora, a suburb of Denver. Holmes appeared like a comic book character: He resembled the Joker, with red-orange hair, similar to the late actor Heath Ledger's portrayal of the villain in an earlier Batman movie, authorities said. But Holmes was hardly a cartoon. Authorities said he wore body armor and carried several guns, including an AR-15 rifle, with lots of ammo. He also wore a gas mask. Holmes says he was insane at the time of the shootings, and that is his legal defense and court plea: not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors aren't swayed and will seek the death penalty. Opening statements in his trial are scheduled to begin Monday. Holmes admits to the shootings but says he was suffering \"a psychotic episode\" at the time, according to court papers filed in July 2013 by the state public defenders, Daniel King and Tamara A. Brady. Evidence \"revealed thus far in the case supports the defense's position that Mr. Holmes suffers from a severe mental illness and was in the throes of a psychotic episode when he committed the acts that resulted in the tragic loss of life and injuries sustained by moviegoers on July 20, 2012,\" the public defenders wrote. Holmes no longer looks like a dazed Joker, as he did in his first appearance before a judge in 2012. He appeared dramatically different in January when jury selection began for his trial: 9,000 potential jurors were summoned for duty, described as one of the nation's largest jury calls. Holmes now has a cleaner look, with a mustache, button-down shirt and khaki pants. In January, he had a beard and eyeglasses. If this new image sounds like one of an academician, it may be because Holmes, now 27, once was one. Just before the shooting, Holmes was a doctoral student in neuroscience, and he was studying how the brain works, with his schooling funded by a U.S. government grant. Yet for all his learning, Holmes apparently lacked the capacity to command his own mind, according to the case against him. A jury will ultimately decide Holmes' fate. That panel is made up of 12 jurors and 12 alternates. They are 19 women and five men, and almost all are white and middle-aged. The trial could last until autumn. When jury summonses were issued in January, each potential juror stood a 0.2% chance of being selected, District Attorney George Brauchler told the final jury this month. He described the approaching trial as \"four to five months of a horrible roller coaster through the worst haunted house you can imagine.\" The jury will have to render verdicts on each of the 165 counts against Holmes, including murder and attempted murder charges. Meanwhile, victims and their relatives are challenging all media outlets \"to stop the gratuitous use of the name and likeness of mass killers, thereby depriving violent individuals the media celebrity and media spotlight they so crave,\" the No Notoriety group says. They are joined by victims from eight other mass shootings in recent U.S. history. Raised in central coastal California and in San Diego, James Eagan Holmes is the son of a mathematician father noted for his work at the FICO firm that provides credit scores and a registered nurse mother, according to the U-T San Diego newspaper. Holmes also has a sister, Chris, a musician, who's five years younger, the newspaper said. His childhood classmates remember him as a clean-cut, bespectacled boy with an \"exemplary\" character who \"never gave any trouble, and never got in trouble himself,\" The Salinas Californian reported. His family then moved down the California coast, where Holmes grew up in the San Diego-area neighborhood of Rancho Pe\u00f1asquitos, which a neighbor described as \"kind of like Mayberry,\" the San Diego newspaper said. Holmes attended Westview High School, which says its school district sits in \"a primarily middle- to upper-middle-income residential community.\" There, Holmes ran cross-country, played soccer and later worked at a biotechnology internship at the Salk Institute and Miramar College, which attracts academically talented students. By then, his peers described him as standoffish and a bit of a wiseacre, the San Diego newspaper said. Holmes attended college fairly close to home, in a neighboring area known as Southern California's \"inland empire\" because it's more than an hour's drive from the coast, in a warm, low-desert climate. He entered the University of California, Riverside, in 2006 as a scholarship student. In 2008 he was a summer camp counselor for disadvantaged children, age 7 to 14, at Camp Max Straus, run by Jewish Big Brothers Big Sisters of Los Angeles. He graduated from UC Riverside in 2010 with the highest honors and a bachelor's degree in neuroscience. \"Academically, he was at the top of the top,\" Chancellor Timothy P. White said. He seemed destined for even higher achievement. By 2011, he had enrolled as a doctoral student in the neuroscience program at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, the largest academic health center in the Rocky Mountain region. The doctoral in neuroscience program attended by Holmes focuses on how the brain works, with an emphasis on processing of information, behavior, learning and memory. Holmes was one of six pre-thesis Ph.D. students in the program who were awarded a neuroscience training grant from the National Institutes of Health. The grant rewards outstanding neuroscientists who will make major contributions to neurobiology. A syllabus that listed Holmes as a student at the medical school shows he was to have delivered a presentation about microRNA biomarkers. But Holmes struggled, and his own mental health took an ominous turn. In March 2012, he told a classmate he wanted to kill people, and that he would do so \"when his life was over,\" court documents said. Holmes was \"denied access to the school after June 12, 2012, after he made threats to a professor,\" according to court documents. About that time, Holmes was a patient of University of Colorado psychiatrist Lynne Fenton. Fenton was so concerned about Holmes' behavior that she mentioned it to her colleagues, saying he could be a danger to others, CNN affiliate KMGH-TV reported, citing sources with knowledge of the investigation. Fenton's concerns surfaced in early June, sources told the Denver station. Holmes began to fantasize about killing \"a lot of people\" in early June, nearly six weeks before the shootings, the station reported, citing unidentified sources familiar with the investigation. Holmes' psychiatrist contacted several members of a \"behavioral evaluation and threat assessment\" team to say Holmes could be a danger to others, the station reported. At issue was whether to order Holmes held for 72 hours to be evaluated by mental health professionals, the station reported. \"Fenton made initial phone calls about engaging the BETA team\" in \"the first 10 days\" of June, but it \"never came together\" because in the period Fenton was having conversations with team members, Holmes began the process of dropping out of school, a source told KMGH. Defense attorneys have rejected the prosecution's assertions that Holmes was barred from campus. Citing statements from the university, Holmes' attorneys have argued that his access was revoked because that's normal procedure when a student drops enrollment. What caused this turn for the worse for Holmes has yet to be clearly detailed. In the months before the shooting, he bought four weapons and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition, authorities said. Police said he also booby-trapped his third-floor apartment with explosives, but police weren't fooled. After Holmes was caught in the cinema parking lot immediately after the shooting, bomb technicians went to the apartment and neutralized the explosives. No one was injured at the apartment building. Nine minutes before Holmes went into the movie theater, he called a University of Colorado switchboard, public defender Brady has said in court. The number he called can be used to get in contact with faculty members during off hours, Brady said. Court documents have also revealed that investigators have obtained text messages that Holmes exchanged with someone before the shooting. That person was not named, and the content of the texts has not been made public. According to The New York Times, Holmes sent a text message to a fellow graduate student, a woman, about two weeks before the shooting. She asked if he had left Aurora yet, reported the newspaper, which didn't identify her. No, he had two months left on his lease, Holmes wrote back, according to the Times. He asked if she had heard of \"dysphoric mania,\" a form of bipolar disorder marked by the highs of mania and the dark and sometimes paranoid delusions of major depression. The woman asked if the disorder could be managed with treatment. \"It was,\" Holmes wrote her, according to the Times. But he warned she should stay away from him \"because I am bad news,\" the newspaper reported. It was her last contact with Holmes. After the shooting, Holmes' family issued a brief statement: \"Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved,\" they said, without giving any information about their son. Since then, prosecutors have refused to offer a plea deal to Holmes. For Holmes, \"justice is death,\" said Brauchler, the district attorney. In December, Holmes' parents, who will be attending the trial, issued another statement: They asked that their son's life be spared and that he be sent to an institution for mentally ill people for the rest of his life, if he's found not guilty by reason of insanity. \"He is not a monster,\" Robert and Arlene Holmes wrote, saying the death penalty is \"morally wrong, especially when the condemned is mentally ill.\" \"He is a human being gripped by a severe mental illness,\" the parents said. The matter will be settled by the jury. CNN's Ana Cabrera and Sara Weisfeldt contributed to this report from Denver.",

        "source": "British police helped Australian officials foil a suspected Lee Rigby-style terror attack on police during First World War commemorations, it emerged today. A\u00a014-year-old boy from Blackburn, Lancashire was arrested after he allegedly communicated with Australian men over a plan to use knives and swords to hack officers to death in Melbourne on Anzac Day, which takes place this Saturday. When the alleged plot was uncovered by Greater Manchester Police, they tipped off Australian authorities who swooped on the terror suspects, arresting five men over the weekend. Police are now working to shore up security for a string of Anzac Day events taking place in London, including services at the Cenotaph and Westminster Abbey to be attended by the Queen, Prince Philip and Prince William.\u00a0. Scroll down for video \u00a0. Arrest: Police have arrested a 14-year-old on suspicion of helping to plot a terror attack in Australia (file photo) Greater Manchester Police said today that the 14-year-old was first arrested on April 2 after police intercepted communications between him and an Australian man, allegedly relating to a planned terrorist attack. He was then re-arrested on Saturday on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, and is currently being questioned by police in custody. Five men from Melbourne were arrested over the planned attack after British authorities passed on their findings to police in Australia, and on Saturday 18-year-old Sevdet Besim was charged with terror offences.\u00a0. It was claimed today that the Australian men planned to knock over a policeman with a car then stab him to death, in a chilling echo of the murder of British soldier Lee Rigby two years ago. A security official told ABC that the terrorists then planned steal the dead officer's gun and go on a shooting rampage which would not end until they were shot dead themselves. The alleged plot is similar to the killing of Fusilier Rigby, who was run over by Muslim converts Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale outside his barracks in Woolwich before they attacked him with knives and attempted to behead him. Attack: Sevdet Besim, pictured, has been charged with planning an attack in Melbourne on Anzac Day. Arrest: A suburban house in Melbourne where one of the alleged terrorist plotters was arrested on Saturday. Tony Mole, from the North-West Counter-Terrorism Unit, said today: 'We have uncovered communication between an individual in the North West and a man in Australia to what we believe is a credible terrorist threat. 'As soon as this information came to light we acted quickly with the relevant authorities here and abroad and this has resulted with officers from the NWCTU arresting a teenager. 'The nature of the communication is currently under full assessment and subject to investigation. 'We are continuing to work closely with the police in Australia and Lancashire and I want to reassure the public that we have not uncovered an imminent attack in the UK and there is no immediate threat towards the communities of Lancashire, the North-West and the UK.'\u00a0\u00a0. Australian Federal Police said: 'Victoria Police and the Australian Federal Police can confirm a link between the arrest of a 14-year-old boy in Blackburn, Lancashire in the United Kingdom on Saturday with Operation Rising, a joint Counter Terrorism Team operation. 'The nature of the communication will form part of the investigation and therefore it would not be appropriate to comment further.' In the wake of the Melbourne arrests, Australian officials have ramped up security for Anzac Day events, while police in Britain are reviewing the arrangements for Anzac Day celebrations in the UK. This year's commemorations are considered particularly significant, as April 25 marks the 100th anniversary of the start of the ill-fated Gallipoli campaign, which led to the deaths of 11,500 troops from Australia and New Zealand. Horrors: Soldiers pictured during the Gallipoli campaign, which left thousands of Allied troops dead. Commemoration: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh pictured laying a wreath at the Cenotaph in 1990, the 75th anniversary of the campaign; they are set to do the same during a ceremony on Saturday. London is hosting three commemorative ceremonies on Saturday - a dawn service at Hyde Park Corner, a wreath-laying ceremony at the Cenotaph on Whitehall and a service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are due to attend the services at the Cenotaph and Westminster Abbey, while the Duke of Cambridge will join them at the Cenotaph and Princess Anne will attend the dawn service. Security is already set to be high at all three events, with those attending told to carry photographic ID, but it could be ramped up further after the recent terror arrests. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu of the Metropolitan Police said over the weekend: 'Following counter-terrorism arrests in Australia this weekend and allegations of attack planning against Anzac Day commemorations and police officers in Australia, we are reviewing security plans at related events in the UK. 'We already have protective security plans in place for major Anzac events in the UK but as a sensible precaution all forces have been asked to review security arrangements at related events to ensure they are safe and secure for the public and officers. 'While there is no information to suggest a specific threat to related events in the UK - and the current UK threat level remains unchanged - the public should remain vigilant.' At least 50 events commemorating Anzac Day are set to take place in other parts of the UK this weekend, including services at Manchester Cathedral, Winchester Cathedral and Oxford University. Australian police said on Saturday that Sevdet Besim and another 18-year-old were planning to use 'edged weapons' to attack officers in Melbourne while Anzac Day celebrations are taking place. The teenagers were said to be inspired by Islamic extremist Numan Haider, who was shot dead by police in September last year after he attacked officers with a knife outside a Melbourne police station. Like Britain, Australia has been suffering from an apparent upsurge in would-be jihadists as the rise of ISIS has attracted young Australians to fight in the Middle East and plot terror attacks at home.

He was released after posting $2 million bond and surrendering his passport. Zelin said that his next move is to get Dr. Moshetto back to work. \"He's got patients to see. This man, while he was in a detention cell, the only thing that he cared about were his patients. And amazingly, his patients were flooding the office with calls, making sure that he was OK,\" Zelin said. Two other men -- identified as James Chmela, 43, and James Kalamaras, 41 -- were named as accomplices, according to prosecutors. They pleaded not guilty in Nassau County District Court, according to authorities. Both were released on bail. A requests for comment from an attorney representing Chmela was not returned. It's unclear whether Kalamaras has retained an attorney. Police officers allegedly discovered approximately 100 weapons at Moschetto's home, including hand grenades, high-capacity magazines and knives. Many of the weapons were found in a hidden room behind a switch-activated bookshelf, according to prosecutors. The investigation began back in December, when undercover officers began buying heroin and oxycodone pills from Moschetto in what was initially a routine investigation into the sale of prescription drugs, officials said. During the course of the undercover operation, however, Moschetto also sold the officers two semiautomatic assault weapons as well as ammunition, prosecutors said. Moschetto allegedly told officers during one buy that he needed dynamite to \"blow up a building.\" He later said he no longer needed the dynamite because a friend was setting fire to the building instead. Kalamaras and Chmela are believed to have taken part in the arson, according to prosecutors. \"The fire damaged but did not destroy the office of another cardiologist whose relationship with Dr. Moschetto had soured due to a professional dispute,\" according to the statement from the district attorney's office. Moschetto allegedly gave an informant and undercover detective blank prescriptions and cash for the assault and killing of the fellow cardiologist, according to prosecutors. He also requested that the rival's wife be assaulted if she happened to be present, authorities said. \"He was willing to pay $5,000 to have him beaten and put in a hospital for a few months, and then he said he would pay $20,000 to have him killed,\" said Assistant District Attorney Anne Donnelly, according to CNN affiliate WCBS.",
        "reference": "A lawyer for Dr. Anthony Moschetto says the charges against him are baseless.   Moschetto, 54, was arrested for selling drugs and weapons, prosecutors say.   Authorities allege Moschetto hired accomplices to burn down the practice of former associate."

The Premier League champions want to reshape their squad this summer after a disappointing season and they could look to offload the 31-year-old, who has struggled to hit top form. Toure, who is wanted by his former manager Roberto Mancini, appears open to a move away from the Etihad if the right opportunity presents itself at the end of the season. Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure has hinted that he is open to leaving Manchester City this summer. Toure is challenged by West Ham's Mark Noble during City's 2-0 win at the Etihad on Sunday afternoon. Toure celebrates with Sergio Aguero and Jesus Navas after the Argentine's goal against West Ham. Speaking to Foot Mercato, he said: 'No amount of wages will make me stay at a club if I feel that I no longer belong there or if no challenge exists for me. 'It would be unjust on my part. There comes a moment where numbers don't stop us, it goes beyond that, even if the English press seem more interested in the numbers than the sport itself. 'For the future, I don't know more than you do, because I will always go where I am offered new challenges. That is in my nature.\u00a0. 'When I arrived at City, [Manuel] Pellegrini was not the coach. Just like the players, managers arrive and leave. As I have said before, I owe it to the City fans to fight until the end of my career at this club. 'My decisions will not be affected by changes in management, but more by the challenges that will be offered to me.' City find themselves fourth in the Premier League table after a dismal run of form and out of the Champions League after a two-legged defeat by Barcelona at the last 16 stage. Inter Milan boss Roberto Mancini wants to be reunited with Toure next season after managing him at City. Toure's form has been disappointing this season and City are likely to try and sell him this summer. Whether Manuel Pellegrini remains manager or is sacked this summer will not affect Toure's decision. Some of Toure's performances have been heavily criticised but the Ivorian remains defiant. 'When things are not necessarily going well in a club, the key players take the fall,' he added. 'I am not the only one to have been attacked even if there is tendency to be harsher with me. Football is my passion, my job and that gives me two good reasons to do as well as I can.'\u00a0. \u00a0.",

Instead, four strong, muscular women sashayed onto the grass, and proceeded to stretch and bend their bodies into yoga poses.

Strike a pose: Former Commonwealth Games pole vaulter turned yogi Amanda Bisk opened the show which celebrated strong women. Bendy: Sjana, who boasts 680,000 Instagram followers, showed off her yoga skills\u00a0. The show opening made clear: We Are Handsome are celebrating strong, healthy shapes - the type of people they have designed their new Activewear collection for. The models included ballerinas and sprinters, while Samantha Harris also made an appearance.

Influencers: Lindy Klim (left) and Sjana Earp (right), both fitness enthusiasts, modelled wares from We Are Handsome's new Activewear range. Daily Mail Australia spoke to the 'models' ahead of the show, which was held at White City Tennis Club in Paddington. Lindy Klim was excited to be returning to the 'catwalk' for the first time in nine years, and since becoming a mother. The beautiful 37-year-old said she wasn't nervous despite being absent from the runway in nearly a decade, and the age difference between herself and the other participants. 'I\u2019m quite comfortable with myself. I\u2019m older than most girls here but 'I'm quite comfortable with my body and exercise a lot so it\u2019s a good fit,' she said, adding that the We Are Handsome message aligned with her health and fitness philosophies.\u00a0. Fashion Week star Samantha Harris was one of the few 'traditional' models in the show. Athletic: The brand emphasised strong fitness-focused women above traditional runway models. Klim told DMA that there is a start contrast in her fitness and diet habits when she is in Australia versus her life at home in Bali. 'I exercise in Bali for two hours a day, but then when I'm in Australia I don't exercise at all,' she revealed, adding that in Australia she struggles to find the time in her schedule. 'My diet in Bali is a lot healthier in Bali than it is in Australia. It's so much easier to eat really healthy food there, it's all organic, locally grown food. 'We don't snack in Bali either - we don't have chips and lollies and things, so I find it a lot easier to eat over there. 'When I'm in Australia I love to go out to restaurants, drink red wine, and i do that a lot during Fashion Week as well as its so social.' Sjana Earp told DMA that she thought there had been a mistake when she was asked to model in a Fashion Week show. Yogis on the field: Flow Athletic co-owner Kate Kendall (left) and pole vaulter turned yogi Amanda Bisk (right) had starring roles in the show. Lifestyle: Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Lindy revealed that she works out for two hours a day at home in Bali, and finds it a lot easier to eat healthily there than in Australia, where her social life sees her out for dinner most nights. The 20-year-old has a huge following on Instagram, where 680,000 followers are glued to her daily yoga poses. 'At first I was confused and double checked it was for runway,' she said. 'I was told fitness influencers were involved, so that was exciting, then I realised it was different from \u2018normal modelling\u2019. '[We Are Handsome] have picked up on the fact social media has such a power for advertising. 'We\u2019re all just regular girls, I think that we\u2019re helping to promote a healthy body image. Fitness isn\u2019t one shape or size, so we\u2019re empowering one another and celebrating every single, shape, size and sport.\u2019. 'Girls who are active are the new shape':\u00a0We Are Handsome design duo Jeremy and Katinka Somers told Daily Mail Australia that they chose girls who embodied the healthy lifestyle for the show. We Are Handsome design duo Jeremy and Katinka Somers are known for pushing boundaries but believe there will be only positive reaction to their unusual model choice. 'There\u2019s a big thing about \"who should be on the runway\" so we know we\u2019re breaking rules by having girls that have never been on a catwalk before (and who are nervous about it),' Katinka told Daily Mail Australia. 'But the rules are there to be broken, times have changed and girls who are active are the new shape. Strong really is the new sexy.' 'A lot of the girls are very big on Instagram and encourage people to follow in their active foot steps, so we have chosen experienced yogis, a ballerina, a sprinter and pole vaulter and people who embody healthy eating too,' said Jeremy.",

Germanwings, a budget unit of German airline Lufthansa, has been in the spotlight since one of its planes was deliberately crashed into a mountain in the French Alps last month, killing all 144 people on board. Germanwings has been in the spotlight since one of its planes was deliberately crashed into a mountain in the French Alps last month, killing everyone on board - a monument has been set up at the crash site. Lufthansa has faced questions about its pilot screening process since the March 24 crash which appears to have been caused by the plane's co-pilot who deliberately steered the plane into a mountain. The Airbus A320 went down in a remote region of the French Alps en route to Dusseldorf from Barcelona. Recordings from the flight data recorder suggest co-pilot Andreas Lubitz locked the captain out of the cockpit before 'deliberately' crashing the jet. It emerged today Lufthansa may face corporate manslaughter charges for allowing Lubitz to fly after he suffered a bout of depression. Last month's crash appears to have been caused by the co-pilot who steered the plane into a mountain.",
        "reference": "Germanwings plane was about to take off when bomb threat was\u00a0received.   Pilot was forced to evacuate the plane while police conducted search.   Sniffer dogs found no evidence of explosives and no one was hurt\u00a0.   Threat comes less than a month after Germanwings plane was deliberately crashed into mountain in the French Alps killing all 150 people on board."

The research focused on POMC neurons, which are a structure called the hypothalamus, that send and receive signals to regulate appetite. When POMC neurons are absent, or not working properly, animals and humans grow dangerously obese. The new findings show in animals that the same thing happens when certain genetic triggers inside the POMC cells aren't working. The team, led by the University of Michigan, looked at how a protein called a transcription factor, and two small stretches of DNA called enhancers, act as triggers for the Pomc gene. All three regulate how often and when the POMC cells use the gene to create the signal molecules that then go out to the body. That little voice inside your head that tells you to keep eating is, in fact, simply a cluster of around 10,000 brain cells. Now scientists believe they have found tiny triggers inside those cells that give rise to this 'voice' 'The POMC region is a central node of the brain's means for regulating body weight, in response to influences from the hormone leptin,' said Malcom Low, a professor in the Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology. Like signal lights that show pilots the path to an airport runway, enhancers guide proteins toward the gene so it can be read. Located deep inside the brain, in a structure called the hypothalamus, the cluster of POMC neurons act as a control center for feelings of fullness or hunger. They take in signals from the body, and send out chemical signals to regulate appetite and eating. When POMC neurons are absent, or not working correctly, animals and humans grow dangerously obese.\u00a0. The latest research show in animals that the same thing happens when certain genetic triggers inside the POMC cells aren't working. The researchers found that the two enhancers act in ways that complement one another, both encouraging the expression of the Pomc gene at key times. Mice born without both of them became obese \u2013 as if their Pomc gene had been deactivated. The protein that latches on to the enhancer, called a transcription factor, is also vital. In the new PNAS paper, the researchers report that the transcription factor Islet 1, encoded by the Isl1 gene, plays this important role for POMC. When the researchers blocked cells of the hypothalamus from making Islet 1 halfway through pregnancy, the fetal mice failed to develop any POMC cells. 'Taken together, this work represents the first example of a neuron-specific gene in vertebrates where we have found both the enhancers and a shared transcription factor that control gene expression in the developing brain and then throughout the life span of the adult,' says Low. Looking to see if the same factors do the same thing in humans will be more complex \u2013 and there may be other enhancers and transcription factors involved. But in theory, it could be possible to find drugs to increase the production of Pomc gene products, or to help silence it.\u00a0. 'For humans, Pomc regulation may be part of the equation of weight control,' says Low. 'We don't know, but we think it likely, that it may be similar to the mouse model, where its role is like a dial, with a linear relationship between the amount of Pomc expression and the degree of obesity.'",

Rescued migrants walk along the quayside after disembarking from the Italian Navy vessel Bettica in Sicily. Italy has pressed the EU to devise plans to stop the tide of migrants on smuggler boats in the Mediterranean. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has urged the European Union to craft long-range, comprehensive policy on the migrants.\u00a0. He said one way would be to establish refugee camps in Niger, Sudan and elsewhere in Africa with UN assistance. Italy has saved some 200,000 migrant lives at sea since the start of 2014. But Italy's 'noble, generous reaction alone isn't enough', he said. 'We are asking Europe to be Europe, not just when it's time to devise a budget.' He said broad, long-term EU strategy, with wider sea patrols and a robust presence in southern Libya, would help combat '21st-century slave drivers' of migrants. Ms Pinotti said Italy would be ready to take the helm of any military intervention if asked and as long as it is carried out as an international mission, backed by the United Nations. 'We're ready to do our share. We're the closest country to Libya,' she said.\u00a0. Exodus: Of the 446 people on board the Italian rescue vessel, the navy said 59 of them were children.

The defence minister said the flow of migrants is not about to stop, saying: '90 per cent are from Nigeria, Ethiopia, Somalia, from places where they are afraid of dying.\u00a0. 'We cannot stop them' from leaving their homelands. Mr Renzi and Ms Pinotti indicated that requests for asylum could be processed in refugee camps in African countries near Libya.\u00a0. These could include Tunisia, Niger and Sudan. Italy's defence minister said that it would then be up to all EU countries to take their share of migrants found eligible for refugee status or asylum. Because Italy is the first EU country the migrants set foot in, they stay in reception centres, sometimes for years, while their requests or appeals for asylum are processed. Migrants deemed ineligible for asylum are ordered to be expelled, but many slip away and head to northern Europe to reach relatives.\u00a0.

        "source": "London (CNN)The Hatton Garden heist, as it will surely come to be known, was every safe deposit box holder's nightmare, every movie director's dream. Thieves using heavy cutting equipment and rappelling gear broke into the vault of an esteemed 60-year-old safe deposit company in the heart of London over the past holiday weekend, possibly taking advantage of as many as four days to rifle through an uncounted number of safe deposit boxes. And they reportedly got away with hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of gems and cash -- even, in the educated guess of one former police official, as much as 200 million pounds, or $300 million. Police were offering few details Wednesday of the robbery at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. Detectives on the scene were carrying out a \"slow and painstaking\" forensic examination, police said in a statement. \"Officers anticipate the process to take approximately two days,\" the statement said. \"At this stage it is believed that approximately 60-70 safe deposit boxes were opened during the burglary. Officers are working closely with Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd to establish the identities of those affected. Police will be contacting victims directly as and when they are identified.\" WATCH: Top five jewelry heists. Throughout the day Wednesday, customers of the business went in and out of the premises, clearly unhappy about not being able to learn whether their boxes were among those ransacked. Hatton Garden is a storied area in London and the heart of the city's diamond trade. The area's promotional website says it is home to \"the largest and most concentrated cluster of jewellery retailers in the UK\" and has been for quite some time. \"History tells us that the old City of London had certain streets -- or quarters -- dedicated to specific types of business,\" the website says. \"The Hatton Garden area has been the epicentre of London's jewellery trade since medieval times. \"Today, it maintains its international reputation as the centre of London's diamond trade. It is one of the finest and most renowned jewellery locations in the world.\" $4.8M in gold swiped from N.C. highway. But how? The police statement did not put a value on the amount of the haul. But numerous British news organizations put the figure in the hundreds of thousands of pounds, which translates into even more hundreds of thousands of dollars. Many of those who rent safe deposit boxes at the company are reportedly in the jewelry trade. But Roy Ramm, a former chief of the Flying Squad, an economic crime unit of London's Metropolitan Police Service, came up with a much higher guess. \"I would not be surprised, given where this one is, in Hatton Garden, if 200 million pounds is around about the amount stolen,\" Ramm said on BBC Radio 4. Because of the long Easter weekend, police did not hear of the robbery until Tuesday morning. This may prove to be an embarrassment, as the Telegraph newspaper reported that the alarm at the business sounded Friday but, as the front and back doors still appeared locked, no action was taken. The website of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. says the company was founded in 1954 and offers a \"secure and cost-effective solution to store and protect important and irreplaceable personal belongings.\" Robbers target security vans in France jewel heist.",
        "reference": "Robbers may have taken advantage of a four-day holiday weekend.   Estimates of the value of the items taken rage from hundreds of thousands of pounds to 200 million pounds.   The heist took place in a historic heart of London's jewelry business."

Gaining ground: The agency started off with just five models and now has 40 including Noreen Carr (pictured) However, next year's annual global event will mark a significant shift if Aboriginal Model Management Australia founder\u00a0Kira-Lea Dargin gets her way. 'I expect at least five or 10 to be appearing in next year's fashion week,' she said. 'Realistically I would like to see up to 10 of our girls go through to next year's fashion week - we do have quite a few of them that have the potential,' she said. \u00a0. What started out as helping out a few modelling mates break into the industry two and half years ago quickly turned into a niche market that Aboriginal models have long been crying out for by the start of last year for the Russian-Aboriginal. Hot right now: Agency founder Kira-Lea Dargin hopes 10 of her girls will join Samantha Harris at next year's fashion week. In demand: Harris walked in a number of major shows at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia. Dargin began representing females who had the runway standards in terms of height and size. 'We focused on high fashion calibre models,' she said. 'We started out with five then it became 25 and now we have 40 models.' Now the agency is about to take on a whole new approach when casting begin for both female and male models aged anywhere up to 60 years old across five capital cities. The Facebook post for the casting call in Brisbane tomorrow has already attracted more than 350 shares and Dargin has received at least 400 emails with expressions of interest. 'I'm expecting the numbers to go ridiculous especially when we go onto Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth,' she said. Dargin says the high fashion market is slowly changing its perspective when it comes to indigenous models but she hoped it would move along more quickly (Cheyanne Fuller pictured) The 26-year-old is finding the mid-market range of big family chain stores such as Bonds, Target and Big W are particularly interested in hiring Aboriginal models for their catalogue campaigns. 'They are a lot more receptive opposed to the high fashion market because it has had a particular look for quite some time,' she said. 'It's a slow process but the perspective is changing - a lot of opportunities are opening but I personally would like to see it happen quicker but there is a lot of caution and a lot of stereotypes linked so you have to face that.' Dargin, whose father is Aboriginal and mother is Russian, faced discrimination when she started modelling in her teens. Big family chain stores such as Bonds, Target and Big W are particularly interested in hiring Aboriginal models for their catalogue campaigns (pictured Nyima Mcnamara) 'It was difficult to overcome both personally and professionally,' she said. 'I thought \"that's who I am - what's the problem with it?\".'\u00a0. She believes that the reason for casting agents hesitance to hire Aboriginal models was because the concern is the fashion platform could be used for political purposes. 'I think anytime you get involved with anything indigenous there is always that political aspect of what's happening in the community and what's happening across the nation and people assume that will come with it,' she said. 'But it's really important to separate individual events and be able to take it professionally and realise that not everyone slots into specific categories.' Dargin believes that high-end brands are hesitant to sign Aboriginal models because the concern is the fashion platform could be used for political purposes (pictured Zoe Byrne) Dargin says with Harris being the most famous Aboriginal face on the catwalk - she would like to see her act as a voice for young aspiring indigenous models. 'She's a very shy girl but I just think that she could come out of her shell a little bit more and be a spokesperson and promote Aboriginality for models in particular and just build a little bit more brand awareness,' she said. 'I think if she spoke up a bit more being in the position that she's in that it would help the next crop of young girls coming through.' Dargin encourages the models that she represents to embrace who their origins.\u00a0. 'I encourage our girls to be proud of who they are as a person and be proud of who they are in their cultural aspect but not to allow anybody else to target you based on other people's actions.'\u00a0. Kira-Lea Dargin hopes to have as many as 10 of her girls in next year's Australian Fashion Week.",

Kira-Lea Dargin says demand for indigenous models is slowly changing in the high fashion market but should be moving faster\u00a0."

        "source": "West of Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)The call from Faleh Essawi, the deputy chief of the provincial council, who we were supposed to be meeting up with, came just as we were about to hit the bridge -- the only safe route from Baghdad to neighboring Anbar province. \"ISIS has taken the east of the city, it's not accessible,\" he says, sounding frantic, rapidly rattling off the neighborhoods and areas ISIS fighters had just stormed into. Moments later, we see the impact: An endless stream of humanity, shell shocked, and exhausted. Parents cradle babies in blankets, some struggle under the weight of their belongings, some carry small plastic bags, while others nothing but the children clutching at their hands. Cars are not permitted to cross this bridge across the Euphrates. The government feels that restricting vehicles will decrease the likelihood of explosives making their way into Iraq's capital. Those too young or too tired to walk pile into metal carts pushed by boys or young men, normally used to carry produce to markets. An elderly woman sits in one, a child in her arms, a worn down plastic doll in her hand. Many don't want to talk, at least not for long. What they just went through is too raw, too painful. One man we encounter describes how ISIS fighters commandeered his house. \"We heard clashes in the early morning, and we couldn't see the security forces anywhere,\" he recalls. \"We saw the ISIS fighters, they just came into the house, they didn't say a word. They just sent a sniper to the roof. I grabbed my children and ran.\" His wife bursts into tears, prompting him to apologize for not being able to talk anymore -- they just want to keep going. Another older woman, sitting in one of the carts surrounded by her grandchildren, starts sobbing the moment we approach her. \"They took our homes and kicked us out,\" she cries. Over the weekend ISIS moved into towns just to the north of Ramadi, which lies 68 miles (110km) west of Baghdad, sending thousands fleeing on foot into the city. ISIS had already blocked off access from the south months ago, and the west was contested territory. The east, until now, was not just a relatively safe zone but the only viable entrance and exit. At a hospital in Amriyat al-Falluja, about a 15-minute drive away, a wounded local fighter winces in pain. He was shot by a sniper in Ramadi that morning as ISIS fighters advanced -- the bullet barely missed his heart. \"We had been warning we could see their movements,\" he tells us. \"But we just didn't have the force to hold them off. We didn't leave a single person we didn't call and ask for back up.\" But none came. Hours after our morning conversation we speak to Essawi again by phone. \"Security is collapsing in the city,\" he screams. \"This is what we warned Baghdad would happen. Where is Baghdad? Where is al-Abadi? \"Just God knows if we will survive this,\" he says and hangs up. Amriyat al-Falluja regularly comes under attack from rockets and mortars from ISIS positions nearby. The hospital's fa\u00e7ade is scarred by shrapnel. The wards are full of people injured during these attacks. Fifteen-year-old Mustafa Ahmed has bandages on his neck, leg, and other parts of his body. \"A mortar fell on our street, one of my neighbors was wounded,\" he explains. \"We went out to help him and the second one fell on us.\" His friend died, he says. In the next room Amal Ahmed speaks softly. \"I was in the garden and a rocket hit and the shrapnel sliced me open,\" she says, as tears roll down her face. \"Something fell out of me and I grabbed it and I put it back in and I lay down.\" She starts to cry harder. Her husband was killed by U.S. forces in Fallujah -- another city in Anbar -- in 2003. Her children have all moved away except her youngest, who broke his arm in the same attack. \"When I see the situation I don't have hope, it's just getting worse.\" A few moments later, we hear two massive explosions from another of the hospital's buildings. They think it's an ISIS rocket or mortar attack so we take cover along with the Iraqi forces we are with in the hallway, away from the windows. More explosions go off in the distance. Then another actually shakes our building. \"Anyone want tea?\" one of the policemen with us asks, laughing as he pours. \"This happens all the time, we're used to it.\" The police chief, Major Aref al-Janabi, radios to his men to respond. Al-Janabi, like so many others, is frustrated with the lack of support from Baghdad. Earlier, he had taken us to the front lines, a long berm that stretches along the northern and western parts of the town that is dotted with fighting positions. He says he regularly provides the joint command center with coordinates for ISIS positions, but so far there have been no significant air strikes or reinforcements. More explosions follow in the distance. We're quickly moved out and leave the town, heading back towards the bridge and the long, snaking lines of refugees. An ambulance passes us, trying to force its way through the crowds. The swell of people fleeing has grown considerably in the last hours -- not surprising given Essawi's dire assessment and warning. \"Ramadi is under siege from all sides,\" he'd told us earlier, anger mixed with an air of resignation. \"I consider the city to have fallen.\" He claimed that 150,000 have fled, scoffing at statements from Iraqi officials in Baghdad that reinforcements have been sent to Ramadi. He has yet to see them.",

Lesley Jonathon Cameron was jailed for life on Tuesday for the horrific December 2013 murder of Maureen Anne Horstman, 67, and her 26-year-old daughter Tamara Alexandra Horstman in broad daylight at their Warwick home, in Perth, WA. Cameron, who was 19 and at the time, also raped Tamara but it is not known if she was alive or dead. A used condom with DNA evidence was found after the incident,\u00a0The West Australian Supreme Court heard. Maureen Anne Horstman (left), 67, and her 26-year-old daughter Tamara Alexandra Horstman (right) were bludgeoned with a hammer and stabbed to death with scissors in their own home in December 2013. Prosecutor James MacTaggart said Cameron's behaviour was 'sadistic' and he went on a 'killing spree'. 'It's violence for violence's sake,' he said. Mr MacTaggart said while it may have started out as a burglary, Cameron was aroused and then 'sexually violated' Tamara. The court heard Cameron first entered Tamara's bedroom where he hit her over the head twice before going into Maureen's bedroom and striking her once to the head. He then returned to Tamara's bedroom and raped her. Lesley Jonathon Cameron has been jailed for a minimum of 32 years for the horrific crime. He described himself at the time as a 'walking time bomb'\u00a0. Cameron's lawyer Dominic Brunello said it was an unplanned and chaotic attack and Cameron panicked. Mr Brunello said his client had a troubled childhood and was 'drug-addled' at the time but was now sorry. 'He makes no excuses for his conduct,' Mr Brunello said. The court heard Cameron described himself at the time as a 'walking time bomb' and that he told police he had taken ice and speed. Justice Eric Heenan noted Cameron had a criminal record that was 'virtually without interruption' since he was 10 years old.\u00a0. In a victim impact statement, Tamara's twin brother Nicholas Horstman, who discovered the bodies, said his sister was a dedicated student, loyal friend and widely loved. Maureen and Tamara are seen here in a family photo with Tamara's twin brother Nicholas.\u00a0Tamara's father said he has suffered many sleepless nights and was 'internally wrecked' He and his father accepted Tamara's university graduation certificate the day after her funeral. Tamara's father said he suffered many sleepless nights and was 'internally wrecked'. Justice Heenan said the women were going about their lives peacefully at home and the crime showed the vulnerability of the community. 'This is one of the worst types of murders one can imagine,' he said.\u00a0. 'It is the kind of offence which every member of the population dreads because it shows the insecurity and vulnerability of everybody in the community to random crime,' he added. Justice Heenan noted there was a possibility Cameron would remain a threat if he did not address his mental health and substance abuse issues. He said just because Cameron was young did not make him any less dangerous but there was a possibility of rehabilitation. Outside court, Nicholas Horstman said he was very happy with the sentence. 'However, no sentence will ever be long enough,' he said. 'To my family, close friends and the wider community, thank you for your support over the last 16 months. I'm truly thankful.' \u00a0.",

Amanda Berry, pictured following her escape from Ariel Castro's 'house of horrors' with her sister (left) and daughter (right) in 2013. The survivor has described in her new memoir, how her daughter gave her the strength to go on during the harrowing ten-year ordeal. Amanda Berry, 29, revealed in her first-person memoir about her abduction and imprisonment by Ariel Castro, that she was left confused by conflicted feelings towards him when he was kind to their daughter, whom she gave birth in captivity after being raped. Gina DeJesus, 25, also shared the details of her horrifying ordeal in a new memoir with Amanda Berry, being published later this week. Amanda recalled how she had learned from TV news that her mother died of a heart attack, aged 43, in March 2006, while she was 'chained like a dog' in Castro's home.\u00a0\u00a0. At this point, the teen had been missing for three years. Castro lured her into his home on April 21, 2003, on a promise to see his daughter, her acquaintance. He barricaded the 16-year-old in a room, told her to pull down her pants and raped her. She was then chained in the basement and repeatedly abused.\u00a0. Four days after she was captured, Castro turned on the news and saw her mother pleading for her safe return. She said that a silent Castro watched Louwana Miller beg for her daughter to come home. 'He has an odd look on his face, and then I realize: He's proud,' Amanda wrote about her monstrous captor.\u00a0. She also described in the People interview how Castro was much stronger than he looked, packing muscle beneath his rotund figure.\u00a0. 'To be around him was scary,' Amanda recalled.'He had these cold black eyes. We were afraid we were going to die.'\u00a0. The Cleveland 'house of horrors' survivors have written a book, being published on April 27. Gina DeJesus was abducted using a similar ploy by Castro a year later. She described her abductor to People as 'always prepared'.\u00a0. It later emerged that Michelle Knight, now 34, had been imprisoned in a separate bedroom since August 2002. A month after learning that her mother, Louwana Miller, had died, Amanda, realized she was pregnant by Castro in April 2006.\u00a0. Although initially elated, she worried how Castro would react. Amanda wrote: 'I think my mom sent me this baby. It's her way of giving me an angel. But I worry about what he's going to do.\u00a0. 'Michelle told me that he beat her to make her miscarry. Will he let me carry my baby?' As the pregnant teen mourned her mother alone amid harrowing torture and abuse, she recalled how she made video tapes of news reports of her mom at vigils and watched them repeatedly. Amanda wrote in the memoir: 'I would rewind and hear her voice. I feel like she's definitely here with me now.' On Christmas Day, she gave birth in her prison of a home to daughter, Jocelyn, with the help of Michelle. Castro appeared delighted to have a new daughter, Amanda wrote. She recalled: 'When the baby started kicking, I reached for his hand and placed it on my stomach.\u00a0. 'I knew the baby would be safer if he was excited about being a new father.' Castro told her that they were 'a family'. The predator took the little girl, whom he called Pretty, to church and out to play while her mother remained in chains in his filthy, dilapidated home. Castro finally took the chains off the three women when Jocelyn started to notice them, even though Amanda tried to protect her daughter by telling her that they were only bracelets. Amanda described her confusion at feeling some warmth towards Castro when he treated their daughter well. \u00a0. She wrote: 'I know it's wrong but I feel closer to him. I appreciate that he treats Jocelyn so well and buys her clothes and toys.\u00a0. 'I desperately want Jocelyn to have a normal life. On the days that he helps me do that, I actually feel some affection for him. I'm so confused.\u00a0. 'How can he be good one minute and so cruel the next?' When Jocelyn was five years old, Amanda set up a kindergarten in their bedroom. Amanda asked Castro to buy books. She recalled how her daughter would sit at her 'Dora' desk while Amanda, acting as teacher, would recite the Pledge of Allegiance with her.\u00a0. In November 2012, Castro was becoming more agitated. He lost his job as a bus driver due to stress and began to wonder how he would be remembered in the newspapers because of what he had done. His daughter Jocelyn began to ask when she could go to a real school. Amanda Berry (pictured left as a teen) along with Gina DeJesus (right) and Michelle Knight were held captive in Ariel Castro's Cleveland, Ohio home for 10 years. The broken front door of the house on Seymour Avenue in Cleveland Ohio where Amanda Berry kicked her way to freedom on May 6, 2013, more than a decade after she went missing\u00a0. On May 6, 2013, a chance finally arose - Castro forgot to lock the door of her bedroom, and Amanda grabbed her daughter and bolted for the front door, kicking her way out through a bottom panel. Amanda described that heart-pounding break for freedom in an exclusive interview with Robin Roberts for ABC's 20/20\u00a0to be aired next Tuesday.\u00a0. She said: 'I didn't know what to do, my heart immediately started pounding because I\u2019m like, ''is-- should I chance it? ... He could be here any minute, if I\u2019m going to do it, I need to do it now.' Following the daring escape, police descended on the home, freeing the other women and arresting Castro.\u00a0. He pleaded guilty in July 2013 to 937 counts including two charges of aggravated murder related to one act of forcing one of his victims to miscarry. The 53-year-old was sentenced to life in prison without parole, plus 1,000 years in August 2013.\u00a0He hanged himself in his prison cell less than a month into his sentence.\u00a0. Neither Gina nor Amanda is still in touch with fellow survivor Michelle Knight (pictured) but said in an interview that they wished her well for the future. Amanda recalls how mixed she felt when she learned from a text message that he killed himself.\u00a0. But despite being chained and raped for a decade by the monster, Jocelyn was his daughter and the little girl loved him. 'I don't know what to feel,' she wrote of that September night, as tears streamed down her face.\u00a0. Amanda and Gina revealed in their memoir, written with\u00a0Washington Post journalists Mary Jordan and Kevin Sullivan, how their captor would play mind games and try to turn them against each other. However they began to establish bonds as they struggled through their darkest hours. Neither Amanda or Gina is currently in touch with fellow survivor Michelle Knight. In People Magazine, Gina said: 'I think we all did like each other at one point but then [Ariel} played us against each other so we couldn't trust people.'\u00a0. Amanda added that the difficulty of their situation was something that only the three women could understand and she wished Michelle the best for the future. The mother said that she was focused on moving forward in life and concentrating on doing the best for her now eight-year-old daughter.\u00a0. Gina, who is studying for her high school diploma, dreams of owning her own business.\u00a0. And both women said what they have been through left them happy, simply for being able to have regular lives, surrounded by their families. In chains: Ariel Castro killed himself in prison in September 2013 after being sentenced to life in prison plus 1,000 years for abducting the three women and holding them captive in his Ohio home. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0.",

        "source": "Lord Stevens is to be investigated over hotly disputed allegations of a cover-up of police corruption in the bungled Step-hen Lawrence murder probe. Last night the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it will investigate claims that the former Met chief failed to hand over key information to the Macpherson Inquiry regarding the black teenager\u2019s race hate killing. The watchdog probe stems from a complaint from Stephen\u2019s father Neville Lawrence. Lord Stevens was deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan Police from 1998 to 2000 \u2013 while the Macpherson Inquiry report was being compiled \u2013 before serving five years as the UK\u2019s most senior policeman. 'Cover-up':\u00a0Former Met Police commissioner Lord Stevens (left) is to be investigated into allegations of a cover-up over the Stephen Lawrence murder probe in the nineties. Sparked new investigation: Neville Lawrence, the father of murdered Stephen Lawrence, made a complaint last October about the failure of senior officers during the Macpherson Inquiry. The complaint concerns a letter to the Macpherson Inquiry in 1998, in which Lord Stevens stated that no officer or former officer involved in giving evidence was under investigation for corruption. It is alleged that the letter included misleading information.\u00a0. However, last night sources close to the former Scotland Yard commissioner said he was vindicated last year by Mark Ellison QC, the author of an official report into the Lawrence corruption allegations. A source said: \u2018Any suggestion that anyone from the Met would seek to withhold the truth from the Macpherson Inquiry at that time is completely untrue. Last year Mark Ellison wrote to Lord Stevens to say he had done nothing wrong.\u2019. Last night, Channel 4 News \u2013 which revealed details of the IPCC probe into Lord Stevens \u2013 quoted him as saying: \u2018Step very carefully, I\u2019m not putting up with any more c**p about this.\u2019 Quoting from a letter he received from Mr Ellison, Lord Stevens was reported to have said: \u2018No one is suggesting that you did anything that was culpable in any way.\u2019. Baroness Lawrence, pictured taking her seat in the House of Lords in 2013, described undercover police officers as 'disgraceful' following the findings of the Ellison review last year\u00a0. The IPCC said: \u2018We can confirm we are independently investigating Lord Stevens following a referral from the Metropolitan Police.\u2019. The Met said that after it received \u2018a public complaint in relation to Lord Stevens\u2019 it made a referral to the IPCC last November. The Met\u2019s statement added: \u2018The complaint has been made in relation to Lord Stevens\u2019s role as the then deputy commissioner and disclosure to the Macpherson Inquiry. Facing probe: Lord Stevens pictured in 2001 alongside Neville Lawrence, whose complaint has sparked the latest investigation. \u2018This issue was raised in the Stephen Lawrence Independent Review by Mark Ellison QC, where he concluded there were defects in the level of information that the Metropolitan Police revealed to the inquiry.\u2019. Mr Lawrence had asked the IPCC to look into alleged failures of senior officers, including Lord Stevens, to provide \u2018full, frank and truthful\u2019 information to the inquiry as well as claims that hundreds of files on past major police corruption probes were shredded. He welcomed the IPCC\u2019s decision to investigate, telling Channel 4 News: \u2018I\u2019m hoping that this time they\u2019re going to come back with a result that can help us to get further into the truth of what was happening during the investigation into Stephen\u2019s death.\u2019. It took more than 18 years to bring two of Stephen\u2019s killers \u2013 Gary Dobson and David Norris \u2013 to justice and they were jailed for life in 2012. Also that year, Home Secretary Theresa May commissioned Mr Ellison QC to lead an independent review into whether there was evidence of corruption in the original Lawrence investigation, and whether evidence had been withheld from the Macpherson Inquiry. Last year she told Parliament that there were \u2018serious concerns that\u2026 relevant material which would show corruption has not been revealed because it cannot be found or has been destroyed\u2019. When the Ellison review reported last year it said one former detective, John Davidson, was suspected of corruption in the Lawrence case, in which he had a key role. Mr Davidson has always denied the claims. Long battle for justice: Stephen's mother Doreen, now Baroness Lawrence, and father Neville have been campaigning for more than 20 years. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge meet with Baroness Lawrence, Stephen's mother, at\u00a0the Stephen Lawrence Centre last month. Damning: In his 1999 report William Macpherson accused\u00a0the Met Police of being institutionally racist. In 1998, five years after Stephen Lawrence was murdered in south east London, retired High Court judge Sir William Macpherson was appointed to head an inquiry into the killing. Macpherson led the review into the conduct of the Metropolitan Police during the murder investigation after the police's initial failure to apprehend the black teenager's killers. In his report, published in February 1999, Macpherson accused the Met of being institutionally racist but concluded that police corruption had not thwarted the case. However, he widely criticised the force's handling of the Lawrence case and said police did not carry out the investigation in an appropriate manner. He made over 70 recommendations, including to extend the number of offences classified as racist, make the police subject to greater public control and protect the rights for victims of crime. He also recommended that police forces increase the number of black and Asian officers, prompting the Government to pledge to increase the number of officers from minority ethnic groups from 2,500 to 8,000 by 2009. And he recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be abrogated in murder cases to allow a retrial upon new and compelling evidence \u2013 something which became the law in 2005 with the passage of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The Macpherson Report was dubbed 'one of the most important moments in the modern history of criminal justice in Britain' and credited with improving police attitudes to racism. Jack Straw, who was the Home Secretary from 1997 to 2001 during the time of the report, has previously declared that ordering the inquiry was 'the single most important decision I made as Home Secretary'. However, Home Secretary Theresa May expressed concerns in 2012 that evidence may have been withheld from the 1999 inquiry. She commissioned Mark Ellison QC to lead an independent review into whether there was evidence of corruption in the original Lawrence investigation and last year told Parliament that there were 'serious concerns that\u2026relevant material which would show corruption has not been revealed because it cannot be found or has been destroyed.' Lord Stevens is now accused of failing to hand information over to the Macpherson public inquiry. He originally stated in 1998 that no officer or former officer involved in giving evidence was under investigation for corruption.",

Today he told Channel 4 News: 'I'm not putting up with any more c**p'   Was Deputy Commissioner from 1998 to 2000 when report was being made.   It's almost 22 years since Stephen Lawrence was murdered in racial attack."

The mammoth turnip which weighs 33lbs and measures 1.2 metres long is so large it hangs over the flower bed. It is not the first time these outsized vegetables have turned up in China but usually they are grown by farmers using commercial fertilizers. Mr Li, from Eshan in Yunnan, said he shocked with mammoth turnip which at 4ft (1.2m) long was the length of his flower bed. He explained he had just picked up some ordinary seeds from the local market and had not used any fertilizer but was careful to water it everyday. It was grown by keen gardener Mr Li who claimed the specimen had become a big attraction and pictures of it have even gone viral. He explained he had just picked up some ordinary seeds from the local market and had not used any fertilizer but was careful to water it everyday. After pictures of it were posted online, one commenter wrote: 'Radish, have you grown so big to become the King of Radish?' Earlier this year another giant vegetable was found growing in China's Guangdong province in a Shantou village. This radish was also 33lbs in weight and measured 2ft (60cm) in length. When asked about his secret to growing his prized specimens the farmer, Mr Chen, said: \u00a0'The most important elements for big radish is good quality fertilizer, good soil and not to grow them too tightly together and plenty of water.' Many people like to buy radish to take home during the Chinese Spring Festival as the Mandarin pronunciation of the nickname of this vegetable is 'Cai Tou' which sounds like 'Good Start'.\u00a0. The worlds's heaviest turnip was a Mammoth Purple Top and weighed 17.7 kg (39 lbs 3 oz). It was grown by Scott and Mardie Robb from the US who presented it the Alaska State Fair in 2004. It is not the first time these outsized vegetables have turned up in China but usually they are grown by farmers using commercial fertilizers. \u00a0.",

        "source": "Aaron Ramsey has told his English team-mates at Arsenal to beware Wales overtaking them in the FIFA rankings. Wales climbed to 22, their highest-ever position in football's world order, in the April rankings to move within eight places of England. Chris Coleman's side are unbeaten in Euro 2016 qualifying and would be within touching distance of the finals in France should they beat Belgium in June - and Wales midfielder Ramsey admits the banter with the likes of Theo Walcott, Jack Wilshere and Danny Welbeck is already flying on the Arsenal training ground. Aaron Ramsey looks to place a pass during Arsenal training at Colney on Friday\u00a0. 'A few of the English lads joke we will never make it but we may have a game against them there,' Ramsey said. 'I hope we can make it and we are catching them up in the world rankings. 'It is an exciting time, we have jumped up the world rankings again and it has been quite a turnaround from the time Gary Speed took over. 'The progression has been amazing and you can see the confidence in the group.' Wales were the biggest climbers in the April world rankings after winning 3-0 in Israel last month when Ramsey opened the scoring before Real Madrid's Gareth Bale bagged a double. Wales midfielder\u00a0Ramsey admits the banter with the likes of Danny Welbeck (above) is starting to fly\u00a0. And Wales could even secure a place among the top seeds at the 2018 World Cup qualifying draw this summer were they to upset the world's third best team Belgium in Cardiff on June 12. 'I have always enjoyed meeting up with Wales and representing my country,' Ramsey said. 'It is nice to be there with your own people from your country and represent them. 'It is a nice break away from club football and a really enjoyable atmosphere.' Chris Coleman's side are currently unbeaten in Group B of the Euro 2016 qualifiers\u00a0.",

Another incredible part of the video shows \u2018coronal rain\u2019 streaming down onto the sun from a loop of material above the sun\u2019s surface. Coronal rain is formed when hot plasma in the corona - the sun\u2019s atmosphere - cools and condenses in strong magnetic fields. The plasma is attracted to the magnetic fields and condenses, slowly falling back to the solar surface over several hours. Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), illustrated below, was launched on 11 February 2010 and has observed the sun ever since. It's goal is to understand how exactly the sun interacts with the environment around Earth. By watching the sun in different wavelengths - and therefore different temperatures - scientists can watch how material courses through the corona, which holds clues to what causes eruptions on the sun, what heats the sun's atmosphere up to 1,000 times hotter than its surface, and why the sun's magnetic fields are constantly on the move. SDO also measures fluctuations in the sun's extreme ultraviolet output, which provides the majority of energy for heating Earth's upper atmosphere. Five years into its mission, SDO continues to send back tantalizing imagery to incite scientists' curiosity. For example, in late 2014, SDO captured imagery of the largest sun spots seen since 1995 as well as a torrent of intense solar flares.\u00a0. Another incredible part of the video shows \u2018coronal rain\u2019 (pictured) streaming down onto the sun from a loop of material above the sun\u2019s surface. Coronal rain is formed when hot plasma in the corona - the sun\u2019s atmosphere - condenses and falls back to the surface. Elsewhere, solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are seen erupting on the sun\u2019s surface, sending out huge amounts of energy. CMEs are the huge waves of material that are seen in images of the sun, and they can pose a threat to satellites in Earth orbit. Solar flares are flashes of energy on the surface of the sun, which are sometimes associated with CMEs - although their connection is not well understood. The video, though, is a reminder of just how beautiful, powerful and active our solar system\u2019s only star can be.

A majority of the British public does not want to Camilla (left) to become Queen if the Prince of Wales (right) succeeds to the throne, a Daily Mail poll reveals. Four out of ten people think Prince Charles should give up his right to be king so the crown passes straight to William (pictured with his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge) Prince Andrew languishes at the bottom of the\u00a0popularity table, with his brother Edward not far ahead. Camilla and Andrew are the only two royals who are more disliked than liked, according to the poll. Despite courtiers\u2019 efforts to have Camilla accepted into the nation\u2019s hearts, 55 per cent are against the Duchess of Cornwall becoming queen when her husband becomes king. This is down from 73 per cent opposition at the time of her wedding to Charles in April 2005, but shows she has yet to win over most of the country. However, she is no longer regarded as the main culprit for the break-up of Charles\u2019s marriage to Princess Diana. The prince himself is held most to blame by 39 per cent, followed by Diana on 13 per cent and Camilla on 12 per cent. There is still great affection for Diana, who died in a Paris car crash 18 years ago, with a substantial majority saying she would have made a better queen than Camilla. Intriguingly, the younger generation is most attached to her even though many of them were not old enough to remember her when she was alive. Among 18 to 24-year-olds, two out of three would have preferred Diana to be queen, while only 3 per cent backed Camilla. Charles\u2019s wedding to Camilla divided the country at the time, and ten years on people remain uncertain about its wider significance for the Royal Family. Fifteen per cent said the marriage had strengthened the monarchy but 24 per cent believed it had weakened it; just over half felt it had no impact. Camilla, 67, was once reviled as the woman whose love affair with Charles, 66, destroyed his relationship with Diana, who was 36 when she died in 1997. Prince William and his son George. Four out of ten people say Prince Charles should give up his right to be king so the crown passes straight to William. Britain is evenly split on the question of whether Charles should succeed to the throne when the Queen dies, the poll reveals. William has the female vote, with 43 per cent of women saying he should be the next monarch compared to 37 per cent of men. Young people are also much more likely to favour the Duke of Cambridge as king, with 53 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds urging his father to step aside. But 43 per cent of the public back Charles to take over from his mother, with a clear majority of over-55s wanting him as Britain\u2019s next monarch. The findings suggest that support for the Prince of Wales to wear the crown may actually have dipped slightly in the past decade. In 2005 a survey found that 53 per cent of people thought he should be king despite his marriage to Camilla, and 43 per cent said he should not. The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall outside St George's Chapel, Windsor after their civil wedding in 2004. Senior officials at Clarence House have nurtured the duchess\u2019s image with carefully chosen public appearances. She has won widespread praise for her charity work, dedication to attending royal functions around the country and emergence as a style icon for older women. The Duchess of Cornwall is patron or president of 85 charities, and has undertaken nearly 1,700 royal engagements in Britain and more than 600 abroad since 2005. Yet the survey reveals how Camilla\u2019s past continues to affect how she is perceived. Just over a third said they had grown to like her more over the past decade, and nearly two-thirds thought Charles was happier with her than he ever was with Diana. Prince Andew languishes at the bottom of the popularity table. But only a quarter felt the Duchess of Cornwall had been a good influence on the Royal Family, and a similar proportion argued that her marriage to the prince had \u2018stained\u2019 the royals\u2019 reputation. Four in ten say Charles should give up his right to be king so the crown passes straight to William. Among those aged 18 to 24, that figure rises to 53 per cent. But overall 43 per cent of the public back Charles to take over from his mother, with a clear majority of over-55s wanting him as the next monarch. Support for the monarchy itself remains very high, with the 88-year-old Queen and the younger royals \u2013 William, Harry and Kate \u2013 hugely popular. By contrast, Prince Andrew was least popular, with only 30 per cent liking him. Charles, Prince Philip and Princess Anne were ranked in the middle. Only 19 per cent would back turning Britain into a republic, although the figure rises to 36 per cent in Scotland, perhaps a by-product of the SNP\u2019s unsuccessful independence campaign last year. Charles, who is said to favour a \u2018slimmed down\u2019 monarchy, will be buoyed by the finding that 56 per believe that the royals should be reduced to the Queen\u2019s immediate family only. By law Camilla will automatically become Queen Consort when Charles is king, but privately officials continue to debate whether she should use a lesser title to avoid controversy. The official position has been that she intends to be known as Princess Consort, but in recent years Camilla and Charles have dropped a number of hints that they would like her to be queen. Asked in 2010 whether his wife would take the title, Charles replied: \u2018We\u2019ll see, won\u2019t we? That could be.\u2019. The duchess herself says \u2018You never know\u2019 when she faces questions about whether she will become queen. Nearly two-thirds of people thought Charles was happier with Camilla than he ever was with Diana (pictured) Princes William and Harry are the most popular members of the royal family, the survey found. Nearly eight out of ten people said they \u2018liked\u2019 the princes, with the Duchess of Cambridge and the Queen receiving similarly high ratings. Women were significantly more likely to approve of the younger royals \u2013 84 per cent said they were fans of Prince Harry compared to 75 per cent of men. By contrast, Prince Andrew was the least popular of the royals, with only 30 per cent of respondents saying they liked him. Prince Charles, his father Prince Philip and his sister Princess Anne were ranked in the middle. Camilla divided opinions most sharply. Thirty-four per cent of people said they liked her, but 38 per cent disliked her. The survey did not ask people what they thought of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s son Prince George, who is now nearly two.

Race issues:\u00a0The shocking incident comes just two weeks after students allegedly chanted a racist song at a black female student. Several students were seen talking to two police officers shortly after reports about it surfaced online. Members of Duke's Black Student Alliance met on the west campus before 1 p.m. for a march to the Bryan Center.\u00a0. They chanted: 'We are not afraid we stand together,' according to a tweet by Amanda Lamb from WRAL. Students chanted: 'We are not afraid we stand together,' according to a tweet by Amanda Lamb from WRAL. However, the incident comes just two weeks after students allegedly chanted a racist song at a black female student. The race hate incident led Duke President Richard Brodhead and Provost Sally Kornbluth to send an email to the student body affirming the university's commitment to racial equality. It also spawned the creation of a group called The Duke People of Color Caucus which released a statement on Tumblr along with a photo of the noose. The statement read: 'To all black students, staff, faculty, and/or Durhamites on campus and in the area: Please take care of yourselves and each other.\u00a0. 'This campus is not a safe space, and has proven beyond any doubt that it is a hostile environment for any and all black people.' School spokesman Keith Lawrence said both Duke administrators and the police are now carrying out an investigation. University and student leaders have scheduled a forum for 5 p.m. Wednesday on the steps of Duke Chapel. Speakers will include President Richard Brodhead. Duke has about 15,000 undergraduate and graduate students.\u00a0It costs about $60,000 a year to attend as an undergraduate, including room and board, according to the school's website.\u00a0. About half of all undergraduate students receive financial aid.\u00a0. @cierane tweeted: 'The fact that black students at Duke pay $60,000 a year and constantly feel unsafe on campus is ridiculous.'\u00a0.",

Family life: Aydian, who transitioned in 2009, lives with his wife of three years Jenilee in Oregon. A spokesman told Yahoo: 'We're looking for a guy who's physically fit, who lives a healthy lifestyle, leads by example, has overcome some challenges in his life, and somebody who our readers can learn something from.'\u00a0\u00a0. With a fan base of thousands on Facebook, Aydian is touted as a role model for transgender, gay, bisexual, and heterosexual men in showing that he has struggled, achieved, and helped others. Aydian, who started taking 'T' (testosterone medication) in 2009, lives in Eugene, Oregon, with his wife of three years Jenilee. Beyond his hit YouTube channel, the entrepreneur has launched his own sportswear brand, Point5cc, which he says is 'designed to highlight transgender pride'.\u00a0. His contestant application reads: 'The battle that can come with the mirror can be completely dark and engulfing. 'As a Transgender Male, having a healthy body and mind is my ultimate goal to find peace within my soul.\u00a0. 'Overcome something': The magazine said Aydian embodies the values they are looking for in their annual Ultimate Guy Search - active, thoughtful and somebody who readers can learn something from. On his application Aydian said he may always battle with his body but being healthy is his key to 'finding peace' History in the making: If he wins, Aydian would make history as the magazine's first transgender cover star. 'Although I may always have some kind of battle with my body, I continue to work every day for a happy peace within.' He adds: 'On days \"off\" I love to go with my wife, Jenilee, out on hikes around the Pacific North West. 'Although I also love my day to day routines, smashing through thresholds and sculpting the body, there is nothing quite like the beauty being outside can do to a person.\u00a0. 'I always have this sense of discovery and drive through my hikes that is unlike anything in the gym or the track.'\u00a0. Though the public vote only counts for 10 per cent of the vote, Aydian is confident he has what it takes to win over the magazine's judging panel.\u00a0\u00a0. If he wins he would follow Iraq war veteran and amputee Noah Galloway, who clinched the top spot last year. \u00a0.",

Brown was unarmed when he was fatally shot by a white police officer, Darren Wilson, in a St. Louis suburb in August 2014. Wilson resigned in November. Attorneys said at the time that the lawsuit would also name former Officer Darren Wilson, who shot Brown.\u00a0. The statement Wednesday did not mention Brown, and a spokesman for the law firm said he could not provide any additional information about the lawsuit. Brown's shooting led to sometimes-violent protests and spawned a national 'Black Lives Matter' movement calling for changes in how police deal with minorities. A St. Louis County grand jury and the U.S. Justice Department declined to prosecute Wilson, who resigned in November.\u00a0. But the Justice Department last month released a scathing report citing racial bias and profiling in the Ferguson Police Department and a profit-driven municipal court system that frequently targets black residents. Several city officials resigned following the review, including the city manager, police chief and municipal judge. The municipal court clerk was fired for racist emails.

A war veteran who swapped the battlefield for a 'dull' job as an army recruiter 'raped young hopefuls because it made the job more exciting', a court heard today. Sergeant Edwin Mee, 46, is said to have abused his position of power while interviewing applicants by raping and molesting 11 young women who wanted to join the forces. The officer - known as 'Jock' - allegedly carried out the attacks on women aged from 15 to their early twenties between October 2010 and September 2011 at an Army careers centre in Croydon. The alleged victims, who were desperate for jobs, were often new to the country and unaware of their rights, Southwark Crown Court heard. Mee, who has served in war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan, denies 17 counts of sexual assault, three counts of rape and one count of assault by penetration relating to 11 young cadets. Jurors were told earlier in the trial that one of the women, a virgin in her early 20s, fell pregnant after Mee raped her in a locked waiting room. An 18-year-old from Sierra Leone also claimed Mee raped her after saying he could help her get a visa. Prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC suggested\u00a0'risk taker' Mee who has fought in war zones across the world found interviewing recruits in Croydon 'dull'. 'But if he could use his position and manipulate it to take small risks at first and then bigger ones, it would make the job that much more exciting,' she said. 'Bullying, talking dirty to the young women, smacking bottoms and ultimately raping young women - he got away with it for a year or more. 'He obviously believed he would never get caught.' She said Mee believed he was the only 'real soldier' at the Mitcham Barracks Army Careers and Information Office in Croydon, south London. 'This case starts and finishes with Sergeant Jock, are you sure that he behaved the way the prosecution said or not - he is right at the centre of it all,' she said. He was British Army recruiting sergeant at Mitcham Barracks in Croydon (pictured) in the Careers and Information Office. 'He, of course, says he didn't do any of the violating, bullying and humiliating acts alleged against him. 'But there appears to be no good reason, or any reason, why any one of these women would lie - let alone 11 of them. 'What have you made of the evidence he gave and of the man whom you are going to be sitting in judgement? 'He is a man who is proud of his record in active service.' Jurors were told Mee thought little of his fellow recruiters, even if they were senior to him.\u00a0. 'He was the real soldier, he was the one who believed that he had the right to recruit those who would join the British Army,' said Ms Cottage. 'You may feel that was his attitude.\u00a0With his promotion towards the end of 2010 did he come to believe in his own importance? 'Was he arrogant enough to believe that when he behaved in the way he did again and again with woman after woman that he had become so important within that office that they would not complain and even if they did, nobody else would believe them?' Mee, originally from Glasgow, joined the army when he was 24 and went on to serve tours of duty in Iraq - where he was attached to the Special Forces.\u00a0. By the time the allegations against him came to light he had acquired the rank of sergeant, and he was suspended in 2011. The court was told that Mee was medically discharged from the Army in April 2014.\u00a0. The alleged offences were initially investigated by the Royal Military Police, before the case was then handed to the Metropolitan Police. The trial continues.\u00a0\u00a0.

        "source": "Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff has revealed the team may have to make 'an unpopular call' for their drivers in light of Ferrari's revival this season. Following the first three races of the new Formula One season it is clear Mercedes will not have it all their own way as Ferrari appear poised to push them all the way. Wolff's remark also comes in the wake of Nico Rosberg's moaning over the team radio during Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix about how slow team-mate Lewis Hamilton was driving. Toto Wolff (left) says Nico Rosberg (right) and Lewis Hamilton will have to deal with some 'unpopular calls' Rosberg then turned on Hamilton during the post-race press conference, accusing the world champion of being selfish. Hamilton insisted he was merely looking after his tyres to ensure they lasted during the crucial middle stint of the race, with the 30-year-old exonerated of any wrongdoing by Wolff and Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda. But Wolff has confirmed that with pressure from Ferrari, rather than his drivers simply allowed to fight it out between themselves as was the case last season, there may be decisions taken on the pit wall during a race that could anger one or the other. The British driver won the Chinese grand prix but has come under fire from his Mercedes team-mate. 'It may be if we are risking a win against Ferrari we would make an unpopular call, not to freeze everything, but manage them more,' Wolff said. 'Our number one objective, which is what we have decided with the drivers, is we have a big responsibility to the team and the brand. 'It's not just about those two guys - it's about the thousand people working on those cars. 'If it gets to the point where we have to interfere between the two of them because we risk losing a race win, then we would do that. Hamiltonhas won two of the three Formula One races this season and looks to be at the top of his game. 'We don't have the gap that we did last year where we can just let them push each other until the very end. We need to manage the gaps.' Suggested to Wolff he was risking Mercedes' DNA as racers - something he has insisted all along would never be tampered with - he replied: 'It depends on what you do. 'We have seen in the past a clear team order that has stated 'you are not allowed to overtake' even though the driver behind may be faster, for example. 'This is not something I can honestly see happening. Ferrari and Sebastian Vettel have proved surprise tough competition in the race for the Championship. 'I can understand why teams in the past have done it because they were under threat of losing a championship. 'Knock on wood, we haven't been in that situation. But managing the situation more, without making such a drastic call, is a possibility now.'",

Scroll down for video\u00a0. Former New England Patriots NFL football player Aaron Hernandez during his trial for murder (file photo) Staff members were directed to treat Hernandez like any other inmate, Hodgson said. Hernandez was convicted April 15 of the 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee.\u00a0. He will ultimately end up at the maximum-security Souza-Baranowski state prison.\u00a0. A lawyer for Hernandez did not immediately return messages seeking comment on the sheriff's remarks. After the verdict was delivered, staff from Bristol County brought Hernandez to a state prison not far from Gillette Stadium, where Hernandez used to play football in front of tens of thousands of cheering fans. There, he told them, 'I'll miss you guys, but they got it wrong,' Hodgson said.\u00a0. 'He didn't really have much of a change in his demeanor. He pretty much still had a swagger in his step.' Hodgson said the 25-year-old Hernandez has an ability to compartmentalize things and lock out the negative. 'He doesn't really look at it as jail,' Hodgson said.\u00a0. 'It's more like training camp.' Hernandez got into trouble from time to time in jail in Bristol County. He was accused of threatening to kill a prison guard and his family, and he got into a fight with another inmate. Asked how he thinks Hernandez will do in prison, Hodgson said he thought he'd be OK. 'He'll probably do fine. He'll be able to talk his way through everything,' Hodgson said, adding that disrespect is a 'hot-button' issue for Hernandez.\u00a0. 'If someone's trying to outwardly and aggressively disrespect him, that could create a problem,' said Hodgson. Hodgson said he had many conversations with Hernandez about his father, who died unexpectedly when Hernandez was 16, with Hernandez telling him how his father commanded respect whenever he walked into a room. 'His father was a huge, huge influence in his life and really his anchor,' Hodgson said.\u00a0. 'If you disrespected him, it's like you disrespected his father.'",

McCoy won on board Elliott\u2019s Don Cossack, who took apart a strong Melling Chase field with a 26-length defeat of Cue Card. AP McCoy celebrates after winning the Melling Chase race at Aintree on Friday. McCoy rode Don Cossack to victory as he prepares for his final Grand National on Saturday. Afterwards, Elliott, enjoying his third winner of the meeting and the man who trained 2007 National winner Silver Birch, preferred to concentrate on Don Cossack\u2019s win rather than the National jockey arrangements. Elliott, who has booked Paul Carberry to ride Cause of Causes, said: \u2018We have got Paul which is good but if we had AP it would have been twice as good. \u2018They make their decisions and we will enjoy today and worry about tomorrow tomorrow.\u2019. A dramatic race saw Balder Succes fall at the third fence and Sire De Grugy come down at the sixth. McCoy settled the matter with a decisive move entering the home straight. Don Cossack\u2019s only defeat in six runs this season came when he did not show his best and ended up third to Uxizandre in the Ryanair Chase at the Cheltenham Festival.\u00a0. Don Cossack ridden by McCoy (second left) leads the field on the way to victory at Aintree\u00a0. McCoy jumps the final fence on Don Cossack as he rides to victory in the Melling Steeple Chase. Elliott added: \u2018Two years ago I said he was the best horse we have ever had. We had a bad season with him but he has proven how good he is. It will be the Gold Cup next season.\u2019. McCoy\u2019s penultimate ride over the Grand National fences ended in disappointment when Eastlake was pulled up in an action-packed Topham Chase in which only 10 of the 30 starters completed. Success went to Nicky Henderson\u2019s Rajdhani Express, who overhauled long-time leader Fairy Rath after the last. It was a sixth win in races over the famous Aintree fences for amateur jockey Sam Waley-Cohen, who rides Oscar Time in today\u2019s big race. Meanwhile, also Gold Cup-bound next season is Paul Nicholls-trained Saphir Du Rheu, 15-length winner of the Grade One Betfred Mildmay Novices\u2019 Chase under Sam Twiston-Davies.\u00a0. Twenty four hours earlier, a second consecutive success for Silviniaco Conti in Thursday\u2019s Betfred Bowl, along with the fact that the gelding has been beaten three times in the Gold Cup, had left Nicholls feeling he did not have a contender for next season but all that has changed now. Nicholls said: \u2018After yesterday, I didn\u2019t think we had a Gold Cup horse but we definitely do now. This is a very special horse.\u2019. The day for jockey Brian Hughes had started badly when he took a fall from a hunter while riding as a guest of former Aintree chairman Lord Daresbury, bashing his nose and lip. But it also proved to be a lucky omen. The last time Hughes had ridden out on the Daresbury estate before Aintree, he landed the 2010 Topham Chase on Always Waining. This time he followed it with success on Cyrius Darius in the Grade Two E-Lites Top Novices\u2019 Hurdle. It was a second race win of the meeting for Hughes, who rides outsider Ely Brown in the National. Winning trainer Malcolm Jefferson said: \u2018I would love to have a nice two-mile chaser and he could be the one.\u2019. liRISH jockey Robbie McNamara was last night considered very doubtful to take the ride on top weight Lord Windermere after being taken to hospital following a fall in the first race at Wexford. Also, Wayne Hutchinson must receive medical clearance to ride Godsmejudge after he was stood down from his remaining rides yesterday following a fall from Balder Succes in the Melling Chase. \u00a0. \u00a0.",

        "source": "Evicted: Hayley Sandiford has been told that postman terroriser Winston must leave her home this month or she will lose her house. A dog has been evicted from social housing for terrorising postmen\u00a0- meaning neighbours can have their mail delivered for the first time since February 2014. Mother-of-two Hayley Sandiford has been told she must get rid of her seven-stone American bulldog Winston by the end of April or she will also have to leave her house in Blackburn, Lancashire.

Angry neighbours have even left notes on her front door saying 'keep your devil dog away', she says. One postman on his rounds reported Winston bounded 100 yards up the street towards him before clamping his powerful teeth around his mailbag. The victim had to cower behind a tree and throw his one remaining letter to distract the animal before diving behind a gate and alerting a colleague to take cover. A second postmen reported being being bitten on the arm and had to kick Winston in the head twice to fend him off. Winston's attacks have led to a 14 month ban on all postal deliveries to 60 homes in his neighbourhood. Residents living on two surrounding roads have been making make a four-and-a-half mile round trips, sometimes by taxi, to collect their mail.\u00a0. Twin Valley Homes housing association has now taken Miss Sandiford, 30, to court and she must find a new home for the dog by 4pm on April 30 or her tenancy is at risk.\u00a0. Obsessed: Miss Sandiford admits her American bulldog has 'a thing' for chewing up mail - but unfortunately this has led to him also attacking postal staff. Legal battle: A housing association has decided to end a ban on postal deliveries to the area of Blackburn by demanding that Winston is evicted. The ruling at Preston County Court means the post to the area is due to resume on May 1. Today Miss Sandiford, who has asked a friend to take in Winston, said: 'I feel sick and gutted to be losing Winston. Winston had been brilliant and I have done everything they asked me to do but they're still making a big deal out of it. Court case: Miss Sandiford outside court last year after Winston was threatened with destruction for attacking a postie\u00a0. 'I have had things stuck on my door saying keep my 'devil dog' away. I don't even like going out anymore I'm not the same kind of person. My kids have been affected at school through it because people would say stuff and my son gets into trouble because of that. We are being taunted all the time. 'Winston is one of the nicest dogs. He is not a danger - I wouldn't have him near my kids.\u00a0. 'Unfortunately he does have a thing about postmen but it is the mail they carry and not the postmen themselves. I don't get much post only bills and a lot of junk mail and he loves ripping them up. He doesn't touch the kids toys he'd rather play with the leaflets that come through the door. 'Winston did jump up at the postman - but he is a very bouncy playful little thing and he forgets how big he is - although I accept it must have been scary for the postman.' Winston's first trouble came in February last year after it bit an unnamed postman on the arm whilst being taken for a walk by his owner's nine-year-old son.\u00a0. The postman suffered a bite wound which broke his skin and he underwent medical treatment in hospital. Although postal deliveries were suspended no action was initially taken against the animal but at 10am on July 9 the 'thick set and stocky built' dog bounded up to postman Paul Warnock whilst he was on his rounds.\u00a0. Mr Warnock who had only delivered to only a handful of houses later told a court hearing: 'Straight away I was worried because it was quite a big dog. As soon as it spotted me it came running towards me fast, at speed. 'Then it was showing it's teeth and growling at me. It was coming at me aggressively, I was frightened. I was backing off then all of a sudden it went for me it grabbed the bundle of mail. It was in the middle of the street because I was backing off so much.' Mr Warnock ran behind a tree for cover and added: 'When I got behind the tree I saw a gate, I thought if I can get inside the gate it's safe. I was left with one letter. It was still going for me. I had one piece on mail, I threw it to take it's eye off me and ran behind the gate. It would have attacked me in the street.' Keen: Winston once ran 100 yards to get to a post bag and the postman only managed to dive into a garden because he tossed a letter into the middle of the road. 'When I got behind the gate the dog was roaming the street. I saw my colleague further up the street coming down, he heard the commotion. I shouted \"Get back get back, dog loose on the street!\".' His colleague took cover behind a gate and watched Miss Sandiford get hold of the dog. Last October Miss Sandiford pleaded guilty to being the owner of a dog dangerously out of control and was handed a six month community order with a six month supervision requirement. She was also told that whenever is taken out for walks, he must be muzzled and kept on a harness with two dog leads and has to be accompanied by a person over the age of 16.\u00a0. Miss Sandiford was also ordered to keep her home securely fenced, but now it appears she must part with Winston to keep her home. David King, one of Miss Sadiford's neighbours said: 'It's brilliant news if they are going to start up the deliveries again. We've waited a long time to get the mail back. My wife is disabled and having to go down to the depot every time we get a letter is hugely frustrating. It's also frustrating that it has taken so long for this to be sorted. Trevor Smith said: 'The Royal Mail could have handled this a lot better and sorted it sooner. I can't understand why they stopped delivering to so many houses anyway. I'm not happy about it. I'll believe the deliveries are restarting when I see it.' Ian Bell, head of Twin Valley Homes, said: 'We're delighted to get this result. The people in the area have suffered due to a lack of a postal service and being in fear of this dog for too long, but now they can see an end in sight. The Royal Mail confirmed a health and safety assessment had been carried out on Miss Sandiford's neighbourhood which highlighted an 'unacceptable level of risk associated with deliveries.' A spokesman said 'Suspending deliveries is a last resort but we take the health and safety of our employees very seriously. We apologise to all affected customers and we are pleased with this outcome.'\u00a0.",

'I am sure the parents will probably curse me in the middle of the night when they have to do bottle feeds.' Kelly and her train dispatcher husband Dean, 41, had a daughter, Charlotte, now 11, in 2003. After eight years of trying and three heartbreaking miscarriages, Kelly gave birth to daughter Emily in January 2011. Kelly then decided to start donating her eggs to other childless couples, in a bid to help as many families share the joys of children. Kelly and her husband Dean, 41, (second right) struggled for eight years to conceive Emily, with Kelly suffering three heartbreaking miscarriages. She said: 'I wanted the eggs to go to a husband and wife so that the kids would be raised in a similar environment to our family - after all, these eggs could have been my children. 'Dean wasn't totally on board but because I have supported him through so many crazy things, he knew it was my turn. 'You can only donate your eggs until you are 35, and because I was 33 at the time I felt like the clock was ticking.' Kelly injected herself twice a day with drugs to stop her period and stimulate her ovaries, and after a few months she will have stored up enough for them to be harvested. She said: 'After the first time I donated eggs I was knackered but so happy I'd done it. Kelly injected herself twice a day with drugs to stop her period and stimulate her ovaries. In all, the nurse has donated eggs three times, leading to three successful pregnancies - twin boys, twin girls, and a baby boy. 'A week later I got a call to say five of them had been fertilised and two had been implanted into the mum-to-be. 'They'd also frozen the others so they could have more kids in the future. 'From then on I was on tenterhooks, hoping her body would accept the embryos. 'Although I knew nothing about the couple, I really felt a connection to them.' In all, Kelly has donated eggs three times, leading to three successful pregnancies. Also, a number of her eggs have been frozen for future use. Controversially, Kelly has told her 11-year-old daughter that she has brothers and sisters. Controversially she has told her daughter Charlotte that she has brothers and sisters out there - and she has elected for her egg donor kids to be able to contact her daughters when they turn 18. She also chose for the kids to be able to contact her daughters when they turn 18 - as she wants her girls to know their half siblings. She added: 'I would love to see if they look like me and am curious to meet them when they grow up. 'Charlotte is so excited by the thought she might get to meet her brothers and sisters one day. 'She even wants to donate her eggs because she thinks what I've done is amazing. 'The people that I've helped have babies have been through the menopause or cancer meaning they could never conceive naturally.

'After I graduated from university, I happened to cross paths with a retired professor, Dr. Arent H. Schuyler, who was looking for someone to sail his boat around the world,' says Liz. 'He was 80 years old at the time and just wanted to help someone else realize his dream.' Liz, who studied Environmental Studies at the University of California in Santa Barbara, jumped at the chance. She says: 'At university I learned about all the damage we were doing to the Earth and the unsustainable lifestyles we were leading. 'I looked around me and it seemed like no one was doing anything about it, and I decided that I really didn't want to be a part of it anymore. 'I knew this trip would be everything I loved in one-a simple, eco-friendly lifestyle close to nature, searching for remote uncrowded waves, learning from other cultures, challenging myself physically and mentally, and going on an open-ended adventure.' Liz, who studied Environmental Studies at the University of California in Santa Barbara, jumped at the chance to discover the world. As well as perfect her sailing skills, the ten-year trip has helped Liz perfect her surf-boarding talents. Sailing around the world offers Liz the perfect chance for scenic stop-offs to practise yoga. After graduating from university, Liz worked as a bartender for three years, before quitting her job when the opportunity to sail around the world arose. She spent three years preparing for her voyage and learning how to operate the sailboat. Liz says: 'It was petrifying to leave the safety and security of the dock and my friends and family. 'I didn't know if I would be capable of captaining a boat this big and managing all that goes into a trip where you're off the grid and away from any help - but I knew I had to try or I'd always regret it. 'When I left I didn't know how I'd make money, and I don't come from a wealthy family or anything, like many people assume. 'I was writing blogs the first year and from this I developed a close relationship with Patagonia, an outdoors clothing company - who have been my main financial supporter since the beginning.' It's often hard work for Liz, as she is photographed here \u00a0fixing the anchor in the ground to secure her boat in the eastern South Pacific. Liz did make a friend when she visited Tahiti in 2013, and even took the cat on the boat with her. Her travels around the world have given Liz memories to treasure forvever, including enjoying herself with the locals in Panama in 2007. Setting off in October 2005, Liz has travelled to a number of exotic destinations, including Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and the Galapagos Islands. Liz has documented her travels in a series of envy inducing photographs. She used a timer to take some of the pictures herself, while other photos were taken by locals. Photo shows Liz relaxing in the South Pacific in 2014; the former bartender admits to sometimes becoming lonely, and right, some deep sea diving. There was a prime catch on this trip in the eastern Pacific, but Liz would have wanted to share the meal with somebody\u00a0. Liz feeds some small sharks whilst on an outer island in the French Polynesia in 2011, during her ten year trip around the world. Liz's daily routine includes adjusting sails and boat maintenance, as well as surfing, yoga, swimming and sleeping under the stars. She says: 'People are generally either awed or jealous, others are totally inspired and excited. 'It feels so great to inspire others to live their dreams, but it's impossible to explain to them what this life is really like; how much hard work there is and that it isn't always easy or fun. 'But that's part of living your dreams - it's never easy, but no work is ever as hard when it's part of your dreams and moving you towards your desires.' The journey throws up daily challenges for Liz, shown here as she battles tough weather in the eastern Pacific in 2008. A spectacular selfie shows a huge wave forms int he background in the South Pacific in 2012. The trip offered Liz the chance to do some teaching at a school in outer islands French Polynesia, in 2011. Liz says: 'I get lonely at times and still hope to find a complimentary sailing partner. 'The kindness of strangers wherever I go, along with the remote love and support from family and friends, always fills up that emptiness whenever I feel a void.' In 2011, the man responsible for Liz's adventure, Dr. Schuyler, died, aged 87. Liz says: 'He never wanted to be on the boat. He just wanted to help me live my dream and live vicariously through me. 'That's how my blog originally started, because I wanted him to be able to share my experiences.' With no end to her adventure in sight, Liz's plans to sail to Micronesia and head west, where she will continue her journey around the world.

So if you're heading there then, get a taste of 'la Dolce Vita' Clooney-style by taking in some of the places the couple made their own and the beautiful scenery that provided the backdrops for their wedding celebrations. Scroll down for video. The Belmond Hotel Cipriani is on the island of Giudecca, just a few minutes by water taxi from Saint Mark\u2019s Square. The views from its restaurant are magnificent. George and Amal's wedding celebrations lasted over the course of a whole weekend and were at some of Venice's most exclusive venues. Where to stay: George's favourite hotel. George loves the Belmond Hotel Cipriani. It was here that both he and Amal, as well as many of their celebrity friends, based themselves during the wedding weekend. Guests at the hotel can try two special cocktails that George created with head barman Walter Bolzonella \u2013 \u2018Nina\u2019s Passion\u2019 (named after Clooney\u2019s mother) and \u2018Buonanotte\u2019 (Italian for 'Good Night' in honour of Clooney\u2019s film Good Night, Good Luck). The hotel is on the island of Giudecca, a sliver of land just 300 metres wide and 1.5miles in length, but its views of some of Venice's most famous landmarks like St Mark's Square and the Doge's Palace are spectacular. The Belmond Hotel Cipriani has double garden view rooms starting from \u00a3477 per night, including breakfast and taxes. The hotel's heated swimming pool, set in extensive gardens, is filled with heated seawater and is the only hotel pool in central Venice. Where to eat: The Stag Party restaurant. Clooney kicked the celebrations off with a stag do at one of his favourite eateries in the city, a traditional-style restaurant called Da Ivo, serving food from Northern Italy. George \u2013 a regular patron \u2013 is believed to have given manager pal Giovanni Fracassi just ten minutes\u2019 notice prior to turning up with his stag party friends, among them former supermodel Cindy Crawford\u2019s husband Rande Gerber. The groom ordered five courses followed by two puddings. His party also worked their way through dishes including antipasto and pasta with truffles during their stay at the restaurant, after which a satisfied George personally thanked resident chef Giorgina Mazzero. The bill is believed to have been around \u00a33,000 but was waived by manager Giovanni Fracassi. George Clooney leaving the Belmond Hotel Cipriani (left) on his way by watertaxi to Ristorante Ivo (right), where he held his stag party. Rande Gerber had also brought several bottles of tequila, which the group enjoyed after their dinner at the exclusive eatery. Producing partner Grant Heslov was also there along with several other of his male companions. Where to soak up the romance: The wedding hotel\u00a0. George and Amal chose to have their celebrations before they signed the papers to be officially wed. Guests included Cindy Crawford, Bill Murray, Emily Blunt and Matt Damon, U2 lead singer Bono and US Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour. And they couldn't have chosen a better venue, Venice's only 'seven star' hotel, the super swanky Aman Canal Grande. Located on the Grand Canal and offering glorious views across the city, the hotel has rooms bedecked with historic frescoes and hallways that ooze opulence with hand-crafted chandeliers made on the nearby island of Murano,. It was opened in the 450-year-old Palazzo Papadopoli in 2013 and offers rooms starting in price from an eye-watering \u20ac850 (\u00a3609) per night, excluding tax and service, but including airport transfers by boat. If you want to really get in the romantic mood, you could book out the suite where the Clooneys stayed on their wedding night... but it will set you back an eye-watering \u00a33,000.\u00a0. The Aman Canal Grande Venice is located just opposite the Cavalli Palace where George and Amal tied in the knot in their official ceremony. The lavishly-painted Piano Nobile Lounge was the setting for much of George and Amal's evening wedding festivities. The palace in which the Aman Canal Grande is housed was built in 1550 for a wealthy Venetian family of traders and seafarers. Where to wed: The 16th-century registry office\u00a0. The final stage in the Clooneys' whirlwind wedding tour of Venice was when they made it all legal in the official ceremony at a Venetian registry office. They an had a choice of three venues -\u00a0Cavalli Palace, C\u00e0 Farsetti, and C\u00e0 Vendramin Calergi. In the end George and Amal chose the Cavalli Palace, a 16th-century Renaissance building in the heart of the city opposite the Aman Canal Grande and close to the famous Rialto Bridge. Its light-filled hall overlooking the Grand Canal makes it a favourite choice for couples getting married. Couples from all over the world flock to Venice to get hitched. Prices for an official ceremony start from \u20ac400 (\u00a3286) for EU citizens and \u20ac1,600 (\u00a31,150) for those from outside the European Union. The bride and groom left on a vaporetto (water taxi) appropriately called 'Amore' accompanied by a flotilla of boats bobbing down the Grand Canal, looking like for all the world like a modern-day version of a painting by Canaletto. George and Amal (left) about to enter the Cavalli Palace (right), where they married - it has incredible views over the city's Grand Canal. A flotilla of boats escorted the Clooneys down the incredible Grand Canal, the dome of St Mark's Cathedral towers over the scene. Tourists who pay \u20ac8 can take a lift up the 98.6-metre (323-ft) tall\u00a0bell tower of St Mark's Cathedral for this spectacular view of the city. \u00a0.",
        "reference": "Art lovers flock to the city of canals set on a lagoon in the Adriatic every two years for the 6-month cultural festival.   The atmospheric waterways and majestic buildings meant it was chosen by the Clooneys for their nuptials.   The Clooneys' favourite hotels are some of the the most beautiful in Italy -\u00a0but they don't come cheap."

        "source": "For all the problems that David Moyes had during his year at Manchester United, you wouldn't associate his teams with defensive frailties and a lack of organisation at set pieces.\u00a0. And since taking over at Real Sociedad Moyes has enhanced his reputation as a manager who brings, if nothing else, solidity.\u00a0. In his 21 La Liga games to date Sociedad have conceded just 29 times, climbing from the relegation when Moyes took over, to an extremely comfortable tenth place. Mikel Gonzalez diverts a corner past his own goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli who fails to punch it away. Atletico Madrid celebrate after going two goals ahead after just 10 minutes, killing the match as a contest. Antoine Griezmann (left) is congratulated by Fernando Torres, but didn't celebrate against his former club. Atletico Madrid: Oblak; Gimenez, Miranda, Siqueira, Gamez; Suarez, Tiago, Koke, Turan (Niguez 81 mins); Griezmann (Gabi 90), Torres (Jimenez 61) Subs not used:\u00a0Ansaldi, Bernabe, Cani, Hernandez. Goals: Gonzalez (OG) 2, Griezmann 10. Booked: Turan\u00a0. Real Sociedad: Rulli; Gonzalez, Elustondo, Yuri, Zadldua; Bergara, Ruben Pardo; Zurutuza (Finnbogason 74), Canales (Agirretxe 74), Xabi Prieto; Castro (Granero 81) Subs not used: Martinez, Hervias, Estrada, Zubikarai. Yet, on Tuesday night, Sociedad showed none of the qualities usually associated with their manager, capitulating inside 10 minutes against the Spanish champions. By the time Antoine Griezmann struck the hosts' second goal, lifting the ball over the hapless Geronimo Rulli after the keeper had parried Koke's shot straight to the Frenchman, Atletico could have been four up, and the game was all but over.\u00a0. Arda Turan had already seen his volley hit the post after being left totally unmarked from a free kick, before Mikel Gonzalez diverted the resulting corner past his own keeper after little more than 90 seconds. Soon after Griezmann narrowly failed to connect with a header after yet more shocking set-piece defending, and the former Sociedad man also came close to tricking his way through the visiting defence, only to be denied by a last-ditch tackle. David Moyes looks on as his team showed uncharacteristic defensive frailties at the Vicente Calderon. Mario Suarez holds off Sociedad forward Sergio Canales as Atletico took control and never relinquished it. Atletico Madrid's Turkish star Arda Turan, who struck the post early on, takes of Gorka Elustondo. Against a team who hadn't conceded a single goal in their previous four games, it was suicidal. In response Moyes' side produced next to nothing. Chory Castro brought a save from Atletico's Slovenia keeper Jan Oblak which was comfortable enough, while Sergio Canales swung a leg at a dropping ball from inside the area, only to see it fly well wide.\u00a0. That was about all they managed until a free kick from one-time QPR midfielder Estaban Granero forced Oblak into his first stretching save with three minutes to play. The champions, on the other hand, without looking particularly good, continued to threaten, helped repeatedly by Rulli and his defenders, who seemed desperate to offer chances out of nothing. Mario Suarez was given the freedom of the penalty area from another corner, but couldn't make contact with his volley, before Rulli misjudged a wayward Koke cross, allowing it to land on his crossbar. Torres worked hard and offered a foil for the talented Griezmann before being replaced after an hour. Diego Simeone calls for more for his team as they kept their La Liga title defense alive. The Argentine stopper also flapped at a cross, allowing Guilherme Siqueira an opportunity from close range, but the full-back saw his shot deflected wide.\u00a0. The win means Atletico are only two points behind city rivals and Champions League quarter-final opponents Real Madrid, although Carlo Ancelotti's side have a game in hand, and the defence of their title is not yet over. Diego Simeone was able to rest Fernando Torres for the final 30 minutes, after the former Liverpool and Chelsea striker had run hard, without much success, alongside Griezmann.\u00a0. His side's season will be defined in the coming weeks, while Moyes' early successes in Sociedad means Real's campaign has already reached a successful conclusion, with survival assured. But his side's defending will nonetheless have hurt the former Manchester United manager. \u00a0. \u00a0. \u00a0.",
        "reference": "Mikel Gonzalez own goal puts Atletico Madrid ahead inside two minutes.   Antoine Griezmann adds second after goalkeeping error.   Champions could have scored more as Real Sociedad offer very little\u00a0."

        "source": "A marathon runner stopped one and a half miles before reaching the finishing line - to propose to his girlfriend. Romantic Ben Parsons, 34, of Brighton, East Sussex, stunned girlfriend Anna Jefferson, 36, by getting down on one knee after running 24 and a half miles. She was watching her boyfriend run in the Brighton marathon with their children Nancy, three, and Thomas, 11 months. Ben Parson, 34, paused in the middle of the Brighton marathon and proposed to his surprised girlfriend, Anna Jefferson, 36. Anna feared her boyfriend was struggling when he started to slow down on Hove seafront, because she was unaware of his proposal plan. Ben then got down on one knee and popped the question and Anna said yes, before Ben ran onward towards the finishing line, still managing to get a personal best timing and completing his sixth Brighton Marathon in 3hrs 36min. Ben, a media law lecturer at the University of Brighton, carried the ring in his bum bag and waited to spot Anna in the crowd on Sunday. He said: 'I wanted to do something romantic to surprise Anna and the marathon has such a feelgood, loved-up atmosphere anyway so I knew it would be the perfect time. Ben Parson had already run 24.5 miles of the 26.2-mile Brighton marathon when he stopped to propose to girlfriend and mother of his two children, Anna Parsons. \u00a0At the time, Anna had been stood in the crowds with children Nancy, three, and Thomas, 11 months. 'Judging by the look on her face, she was certainly surprised. 'Once Anna had said 'yes' and we'd had a big sweaty hug I had to get on the move again so my legs wouldn't seize up. 'As I ran off I got a big cheer from the crowd. It felt like the climax of a minor British rom-com. 'I had an extra spring in my step for the last mile and a half.' 'As I ran off I got a big cheer from the crowd. It felt like the climax of a minor British rom-com': After Anna said yes, Ben carried on with the marathon. He said that the pressure of the proposal spurred him on and brought the finishing line a bit closer. But he joked: 'If I hadn't seen her in the crowd maybe I would have just carried on to the end and taken the ring back to Argos.' Anna, who works for Arts Council England, and has been dating Ben since they met at City College Brighton in 2002, said she never expected the proposal. She said: 'There had been a guy just before him who had got a cramp and had to stop for his friends to massage his leg. Newly-engaged: The happy couple are stood after the surprise proposal with their two children. 'Then Ben started slowing down and I thought 'oh god he's going to collapse or something'. 'I had no idea what he was planning. 'In hindsight he had suggested before that I wear something nice so we could go out for something to eat afterwards. I should really have twigged when he asked me to take his brogues in the bottom of the pram. 'Who wears brogues after running a marathon?'",

The total amount of benefits paid to staff at some companies exceeds what the firms pay in corporation tax, according to the study by Citizens UK. Critics have accused supermarkets of relying on benefits to ensure their staff earn enough to put food on the table without them having to raise wages\u00a0. The charity is campaigning for the adoption of the Living Wage - \u00a39.15 an hour in London and \u00a37.85 for the rest of the UK - across both the public and private sector. It estimates this would reduce the need for in-work benefits by \u00a36.7bn a year, which would make a massive dent in the \u00a312billion reduction in welfare spending which the Conservatives say is necessary. The current minimum wage for those over 21 is \u00a36.50 an hour and will rise to \u00a36.70 in October, but this is well below what the Government accepts is needed by many people, particularly those with children, to make ends meet. The charity\u2019s report complains: \u2018The public subsidy enables profitable businesses to get away with paying low wages.\u2019. Its report says Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s posted combined profits of \u00a33.9bn last year, but between them cost the taxpayer more than \u00a3750m in benefits paid to their staff. Tesco paid \u00a3519m in tax but received \u00a3364m in public subsidy for its 209,000 low-paid workers. Asda spent \u00a3150m in tax but its 120,000 low-paid workers received \u00a3221m in benefits. Morrisons\u2019 tax bill was \u00a362m while its 83,000 low-paid workers received \u00a3190m in benefits and Sainsbury\u2019s paid \u00a3180m in tax, almost exactly as much as its low-paid staff received from the public purse. Of all the profitable companies examined by the charity, Next had the highest average subsidy of \u00a32,087 per head given its high proportion of young employees who are typically paid just above the minimum wage of \u00a36.70 an hour. Next is run by the Conservative peer, Lord Wolfson, who came under fire last month for criticising the whole idea of a Living Wage as an \u2018invention\u2019. Next is run by the Conservative peer, Lord Wolfson, who came under fire last month for criticising the whole idea of a Living Wage as an \u2018invention\u2019. He argued that pushing up wages will block recruitment. \u2018For very many people, the retail sector provides useful income and Next has 30 applications for every vacancy. Raising wages too fast will simply reduce employment opportunities,\u2019 he said. Other firms who rely on the taxpayer to top up staff wages include Amazon, fast food outlets and local authorities, where cleaning and care workers, for example, are already paid by the taxpayer. Paul Regan, chairman of Citizens UK, said: \u2018The major retailers post profits and pay tax, but the Treasury has to step in and often pays out more than it gets in to help those workers for whom work does not pay.\u2019. He called on the next government to show leadership \u2018by implementing the living wage into all public sector commissioning\u2019. The Rev Karen Rooms, Area Dean for Nottingham South and member of the Citizens UK Council, said: \u2018The figures revealed by this research are shocking, as the true scale of the subsidy of big business becomes clear. \u2018The huge profits made by some of these high street names are made off the back of poverty-wages. In some instances the amount of tax they pay doesn\u2019t even cover the wage top-ups we all have to chip-in and help with through the Treasury. \u2018At a time of austerity when all sectors of society have to make savings it seems obscene that big business isn\u2019t playing its part to help the country recover.\u2019. All of the main political parties support the living wage. Last week, David Cameron said businesses that can afford to pay it \u2018should consider doing so\u2019. Boris Johnson, the London mayor, said it was \u2018madness\u2019 that large employers paid chief executives huge salaries while their lowest-paid workers were subsidised by the taxpayer. Labour has made demands for employers to pay the Living Wage a major plank of its election strategy. However, the former Labour Cabinet minister Alan Milburn, chairman of the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, said it could take 10 years to make the living wage a reality. He said: \u2018Employers will have to pay more but wages cannot rise without improved productivity and more skills training. We will need a 10-year transition period to become a living wage country.\u2019. Charles Cotton, of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, warned wage rises will hit employment, saying: \u2018If employees weren\u2019t getting subsidies, would firms employ as many people or would they cut back?\u2019. Supermarkets said they paid above the minimum wage of \u00a36.50 an hour for those aged over 21, regularly reviewed pay and gave employees benefits such as staff discounts. Asda, which is part of the US retail goliath Walmart, said pay and benefits \u2018should be considered in the round\u2019. In the USA, it is estimated that Walmart\u2019s low-wage workers cost U.S. taxpayers an estimated $6.2 billion (\u00a34.2bn) in public assistance including food stamps, Medicaid and subsidised housing. Morrisons said discounts and profit-sharing took the pay of many over the living wage. Sainsbury\u2019s said it offered employees a discount card, annual bonus and paid breaks. Tesco said it paid, on average, 4-7per cent more than major competitors and had contributed \u00a31.5bn in tax through business rates, employer national insurance and corporation tax in 2014. The British Retail Consortium said pay and benefits packages equated to an average of about \u00a38.40 an hour and the industry had paid \u00a319.5bn in \u2018core business taxes\u2019 last year.\u00a0. Asda, which is part of the US retail goliath Walmart, said pay and benefits \u2018should be considered in the round\u2019. \u00a0.",

Ahead of the match at City\u2019s Academy Stadium we tell you everything you need to know. Dominic Solanke (second right) scores for Chelsea against Shakhtar Donetsk in the UEFA Youth League final. WHAT\u2019S THE OCCASION? It\u2019s the first leg of the FA Youth Cup final and it\u2019ll take place at City\u2019s 7,200-capacity Academy Stadium, in the shadow of the main Etihad Stadium and part of their \u00a3200m Etihad Campus that opened last year. The match kicks off at 7.45pm and will be shown live on ITV4. The second leg takes place next Monday at Stamford Bridge. HOW DID THE TEAMS GET THERE? City started their campaign with a 2-0 win over Oxford United in the third round just before Christmas, with goals from Marcus Wood and Bersant Celina sealing a comfortable win. Jason Wilcox\u2019s team really had their shooting boots on in the fourth round, thrashing Coventry City 8-2. Brandon Barker was the star with three of them, while Thierry Ambrose (2), Pablo Maffeo, Javairo Dilrosun and Denzeil Boadu also cashed in. Man City's Thierry Ambrose (centre) scores his second goal during the 8-2 victory over Coventry. Manchester City's Isaac Buckley Ricketts (left) celebrates scoring during the semi-final against Leicester. It wasn\u2019t as straightforward in the next round, with a solitary Celina strike beating Stoke City, but City were back to their free-scoring best in beating Crewe Alexandra 6-1 in the last eight. Having fallen behind early on, City stormed back to win thanks to goals from Aaron Nemane, Barker (2), Boadu, Celina and Ambrose. That set up a two-legged semi-final with Leicester City and they were very keen to get the job done, winning the home first leg 3-0. Nemane (2) and Boadu continued their scoring form. The second leg at the King Power Stadium was a formality and, having fallen behind to a second-half penalty, two goals in stoppage time from Isaac Buckley and Barker sealed a 5-1 aggregate win. Chelsea started their campaign at the beginning of December and were drawn away to Leeds United. An Izzy Brown penalty and a late second from Dominic Solanke got the Blues Youth Cup defence underway. Huddersfield Town were beaten 6-1 in the fourth round, with England under 18 star Solanke scoring a hat-trick. Tammy Abraham grabbed two and Kasey Palmer rounded off an emphatic win. And Joe Edwards\u2019 team went goal crazy again in the fifth round, beating Swansea 6-0. This time it was Abraham scoring a treble and Solanke adding two. Palmer also got on the scoresheet. A tough trip to Newcastle United followed but the Blues finally prevailed in extra time with Brown, Solanke and Abraham on the scoresheet in a 3-0 win at St James\u2019 Park. That set up a tasty semi-final tie with Tottenham and all seemed lost when Spurs took a 2-0 lead from the first leg at White Hart Lane. Chelsea were to fall further behind in the second leg at Stamford Bridge but mounted an extraordinary fightback. Izzy Brown (centre) scores for Cheslea against Tottenham as they staged a thrilling comeback last month. Goals from Solanke and Brown gave them hope before the break, before two in two minutes from Solanke and Charlie Colkett just after turned the game on its head. A Colkett penalty then put daylight between the teams as Chelsea won a thrilling tie 5-4 on aggregate. YOUTH CUP PEDIGREE. Manchester City have twice lifted the FA Youth Cup - in 1986 and 2008. The last of those saw them defeat Chelsea 3-1 at the Etihad after a 1-1 draw in London. Slovakian Vladimir Weiss was the star performer. He went on to make just five first-team appearances for City and now plays, aged 25, for Lekhwiya in the Qatari Stars League. Chelsea have made the competition their own in recent years and this is their fifth final in six seasons. Their wins in 2010, 2012 and 2014 added to earlier successes in 1960 and 1961.\u00a0. WHAT ARE THEY SAYING? City coach Jason Wilcox: \u2018Our job is to recruit local lads. If we can get a group of Manchester-born lads into the first team then that's the ideal scenario. To do that is going to be really difficult but that's the challenge. We don't want local lads playing for Tottenham, Arsenal or Chelsea. It\u2019s up to us to make sure that, via the scouting, we have at least the opportunity of showing them our programme. I\u2019m convinced once they see us it\u2019s very difficult to walk away from.\u2019\u00a0. Chelsea coach Joe Edwards: \u2018Winning breeds confidence so to have a group of players coming back for this game who were crowned European champions last week [when the Under-19s won the UEFA Youth League] is a massive plus for us. Once you get a taste of winning, you want that feeling again and again.\u2019\u00a0. PLAYERS TO WATCH. MANCHESTER CITY. Brandon Barker - speedy winger who has been on the books at City\u2019s academy since the age of eight. The Manchester-born teenager made a positive impression with 13 goals for the under 18s last season and has since progressed into Patrick Vieira\u2019s Elite Development Squad. Has scored six time on the Youth Cup run and is an England under 19 international. Brandon Barker is an England Under 19 international and scored 13 goals for City's under 18s last season. Thierry Ambrose - capable of playing anywhere across the forward line, Ambrose was signed from Auxerre\u2019s youth teams in 2013. Impressed in his first season with the under 18s, scoring 22 goals in 32 matches, enough to earn the Parisian a place in the EDS team. Has scored three times during City\u2019s Youth Cup run. Ambrose (centre) scored 22 goals in 32 matches for City's under 18s after signing from Auxerre. Aaron Nemane - another who has scored three times during the Youth Cup run. Right winger Nemane made his debut for the City under 18 side at just 14 and made quite an impact by scoring twice. Has played mainly in the under 18 team but did travel to Croatia with the EDS squad last pre-season. Aaron Nemane (right) made his debut for Manchester City's under 18 side aged just 14. CHELSEA. Dominic Solanke - enjoying an extraordinary season and hoping to win the Youth Cup for the second successive season having scored two goals in the last five minutes to sink Fulham last year. With 34 goals for Chelsea this season, he inspired them to UEFA Youth League success a week ago having scored in every round. Should he score in the final, he will also have scored in each round of the Youth Cup. England under 18 international. Solanke (left) has been in prolific form for Chelsea both at home and abroad this season. Jay Dasilva - earned rave reviews for his performances in the Youth League, with Ian Wright suggesting he was already better than any left-back in the Premier League. Still only 16, his mature performance have seen him already established in the under 21 team. Jay Dasilva has impressed for Chelsea at left-back and is a regular for the Under 21 team. Charlie Colkett - captain of the side and an important figure in the Chelsea midfield. Will set the tempo and drive the team forward with direct runs and intelligent passes. Very impressive all season, especially on the continental stage. Charle Colkett (right) is captain of Chelsea's youth cup side and has impressed all season.",

The London Mayor, who appeared alongside Mr Miliband on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, launched a furious personal assault on his rival - with their encounter descending into a furious shouting match. But Mr Miliband, who beat his elder brother David to the Labour leadership in 2010, ended up laughing off the attack, responding: 'Come on Boris, you're better than that.' Animated: Boris Johnson wags a finger at Miliband, who appears to have a clenched fist, on the Andrew Marr Show this morning. The rivals' encounter quickly descended into a slanging match. No let-up: The Tory and Labour politicians go at it hammer and tongs in front of their TV audience. The heated exchange ends with presenter Andrew Marr (right) injecting and the men trying to laugh about it. Mr Johnson's verbal mauling of the Labour leader comes after the Tories were accused of 'descending into the gutter' for claiming that Mr Miliband may 'stab the country in the back' by doing a deal with the SNP to get into power. But today, Mr Johnson insisted that Labour could not take power without the support of the SNP, and claimed the prospect was 'actually deeply alarming'. He said Mr Miliband would have to take help from the Scottish party 'crouching on his back like a monkey' - making it impossible for him to govern in the interests of the whole UK. The London Mayor added: I am not saying that your brother had to present himself at A&E with a dagger in his back... [but] he [Ed Miliband] would do more damage to this country than he did to his brother, and that is the key point.' Verbal onslaught: Mr Johnson said that Labour could not take power without the support of the SNP. Time to go: Mr Johnson and Mr Miliband leave the politics programme after their massive on-air argument. Mr Miliband arrived at the BBC studios in Central London by car, while Mr Johnson cycled there. Ed Miliband won the Labour leadership in September 2010 by narrowly beating his brother David, who had been the runaway favourite for the top job. The younger sibling won the ballot by just over 1 per cent after the second, third and fourth preference votes came into play. David had garnered the majority of support from Labour MPs and party members - but Ed was ahead with the trade-union members. He hugged David after the result was announced - but later admitted the decision to stand against him caused deep division between the brothers. David stayed on as an MP until 2013, then announced he was quitting Parliament to become head of the giant New York-based charity International Rescue Committee. Mr Miliband hit out at the Conservatives for their campaign, saying: 'They are so desperate they are reduced to trying to set one part of the country against another.' Mr Johnson insisted the Conservative attacks on the SNP were not risking the union. 'I'm so proud and so positive about what's happening in this country at the moment, and I just think there are unnecessary risks involved in this Labour-SNP condominium,' he said. 'So the answer would be, no I don't think we are in any way imperiling the union. The people who would imperil the union, because that's what their party is called, is the Scottish Nationalist Party. 'And I imagine their strategy - like the parable, or the fable, of the frog and the scorpion - is to be allowed to be carried across the river and then ultimately to sting... [he is cut off]' The Conservatives have made the prospect of a Labour administration that's reliant on SNP votes one of the central planks of their election campaign in the last fortnight. But Mr Miliband has repeatedly insisted that he will not make any 'deals' with the SNP to become Prime Minister. And he told Andrew Marr today: 'No coalition, no tie-ins, I have said no deals - I have been clear about that. I am not doing deals with the Scottish Nationalist Party.' Asked explicitly whether he was ruling out a confidence-and-supply agreement, he replied: 'No deals.' Ed Miliband and Boris Johnson livened up the election campaign this morning when they went head-to-head on live TV. After being interviewed separately by presenter Andrew Marr, the pair of would-be Prime Ministers were brought together to challenge each other directly. Mr Miliband kicked off the heated exchange by demanding to know if Mr Johnson backed rules that allow wealthy foreigners living in Britain to avoid tax on their overseas earnings. He said: \u2018Are you for keeping non-dom status? You\u2019re defending those people who come here, they live here for 30 years, they are permanently here and they don\u2019t pay taxes here.\u2019. Mr Johnson responded: \u2018Hang on, is this the Ed Miliband who was in the Treasury with Gordon Brown for about ten years? Are you the same creature? I mean, is there some sort of doppelganger going on?\u2019. The Labour leader hit back, saying: \u2018Don\u2019t get rattled, come on now. Andrew Marr interjected to ask the London Mayor to defend inflammatory remarks in which he had accused Mr Miliband of being a back stabber. He said: \u2018You attacked Ed Miliband very forcibly today, Boris, for backstabbing. Do you really think that is a fair approach to somebody who is standing in an election? Before Mr Johnson could speak, Mr Miliband said: \u2018He doesn\u2019t believe it. Come on, Boris, you are better than that.\u2019. But the London Mayor replied: \u2018I am not saying that your brother had to present himself at A&E with a dagger in his back.\u00a0But he would do more damage to this country than to his brother - and that is the key point.\u2019.",
        "reference": "London Mayor appeared with Mr Miliband on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show.   Mr Johnson said Ed would damage UK more than he'd damaged his sibling.   But he conceded: 'I'm not saying your brother had dagger in the back'   Labour leader laughed off row, saying: 'Boris, you're better than that'"

Obama promptly embraced the local color by making an unscheduled late night visit to the museum dedicated to the island's most famous son. Scroll down for video\u00a0. Barack Obama made an unscheduled stop at the Bob Marley museum while on an official visit to Jamaica. The U.S. President walks around the museum with tour guide Natasha Clark during his unannounced visit. On a tour of the house where the reggae legend lived until his death in 1981, Obama, looking relaxed in shirtsleeves, was shown a trophy room where Marley's Grammys and platinum records were on display.\u00a0. At the same time Marley's hit song 'One Love' played over the loudspeaker. The musician's family transformed the rambling property into a museum complete with a well-equipped 80-seat theatre, a photographic gallery, and a gift shop selling T-shirts, posters and CDs and other Bob Marley memorabilia.\u00a0. One of the rooms Obama explored held the late reggae star's platinum records and a Grammy award. Thee president looks at selection of Bob Marley's gold records at the Bob Marley Museum in Kingston. The building was home to Marley until his death in 1981 and was converted into a museum by his family. 'What a wonderful tour,' the president told museum guide Natasha Clark. 'I still have all the albums.'\u00a0. Obama is in Jamaica to meet the 15-member Caribbean Community bloc.\u00a0. The visit is part of an official Caribbean summit seeking to reassert U.S. leadership in the region at a time when oil-producing Venezuela's economic clout may be receding. The Caribbean region collectively cheered when Obama was first elected president in 2008. Calypso and reggae songs were written in his honor, the French Caribbean island of Martinique named a road after him, and Antigua's highest mountain officially became 'Mount Obama' as the small country saluted him as a symbol of black achievement.\u00a0. Obama thanked the guide for a wonderful tour and told her he still owns all of Bob Marley's albums. Obama is in Jamaica to meet the 15-member Caribbean Community bloc to discuss energy and security. As the first U.S. president to visit Kingston since Ronald Reagan in 1982, Obama faces the challenge of convincing Caribbean island leaders that Washington is genuinely re-engaging after a long period of perceived neglect of its smaller, poorer neighbors. The visit is expected to be dominated by discussions on energy, security and trade with the 15-member Caribbean Community, or Caricom. Some analysts say a key reason why Washington is suddenly paying attention to the Caribbean Basin is that it wants to wean the islands off dependence on cut-rate Venezuelan oil that Caracas has long used to wield influence in the region.\u00a0\u00a0. From Jamaica, Obama will travel to Panama to attend a Western Hemisphere summit, where Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has made clear he will confront Obama over new U.S. sanctions. Obama will also cross paths at the Summit of the Americas with Cuban President Raul Castro for the first time since the two announced a historic opening between their countries in December.",

'That's how we came up with the names. Pretty much everything is done now and under control. I'm sure a few things will come up next week but it's pretty much sorted.'

For the 27-year-old's many fans and friends in the town, \u00a0at least part of the wedding of the year will be a spectator sport, played out on the streets of the community. It is understood local residents and businesses urged the former Wimbledon champion to hold the April 11 service at the cathedral rather than at luxury hotel Cromlix House in nearby Kinbuck \u2013 so they too could toast his big day. The reception will be held at Cromlix, which Murray owns.\u00a0. Kim shows off her engagement ring at the\u00a0Australian Open in Melbourne, Australia, last January\u00a0. The 300-seat, 12th century cathedral is much bigger than the chapel at Cromlix, which seats only 28. Thousands are expected to line Dunblane High Street on the day. Murray's uncle Niall Erskine said: 'I'm sure it will be a popular decision, as he's had so much support from the people of Dunblane in the past. Andy has admitted that, food aside, he's left much of the preparation for the big day to his betrothed: 'Kim's been pretty much doing it' 'I've tried to help out when she has asked, but I haven't been over-involved. I did all the food and cake tasting which I really enjoyed, although I didn't think I was going to. He added: 'It's a big day for Kim. Pretty much everything is taken care of now. She seems fairly relaxed but as we get closer that might change.'",

        "source": "When it comes to playing tricks on people, especially parents it's important to know when to stop. However, this did not appear to cross the mind of teenager Lily Sharp, who lives in the UK, when she decided to prank her own mother. Rather than put a whoopie cushion on her chair or balance flower on top of a door, Lily decided to amuse herself by faking her own kidnapping- any parents worse fear. As mean-spirited as the joke appeared, Lily certainly took the steps in order to make the prank as convincing as possible. Scroll down for video\u00a0. Lily Sharp perhaps took a joke too far after convincing her own mother she had been kidnapped\u00a0. She began by texting her mother a seemingly innocent message: 'You didn't tell me the decorator man was coming mate!' Before adding in a quick reference from the famous Liam Neeson kidnapping film Taken. She continued: 'I thought I was guna get taken man. Thought he was tryna trick me into getting into the house' (sic) before adding, 'Not happy young lady.'\u00a0. Lily began her prank by convincing her mother that she had allowed a stranger to enter their home. She then took the prank a step further by pretending to her panicked mum that the intruder had her phone, informing her mother that the kidnapper would require \u00a34000 for her return\u00a0. Her suspicious mother replies immediately with: 'Whaaaat? What decorator?!?!! Call me. There is no decorator.' Lily then plays on her mother's fears by pretending that the intruder now has possession of the phone simply replying: 'She knows that now.' At this point Lily's mother is completely fooled and has become more frantic insisting that her daughter calls her immediately.\u00a0. 'Who knows it!! Call me please' she replies before adding, 'Now' After her mother reveals that she is sending the police round Lily reveals that it was all a trick. She convinces her mother by sending a picture of herself, her mother does not find it amusing. At this point many would have called their panicking parent however Lily decides to take it up a notch. 'My name is Victor' she replies before demanding a ransom 'I have your child. I want \u00a34000 to get her back.' Lily's mother tries to keep calm texting back: 'Sending a neighbour round now' But Lily simply insights more panic in her mother when she replies: 'Good luck with that. I've already gone. She's with me.'\u00a0. At this point Lily's mother informs who she believes to be the intruder that she has called the police: 'Ok well police will be.' Lily attempts one more cheeky text as the intruder with 'She says hello' before revealing that it was all a trick.\u00a0. She then reassures her mum by sending a picture of herself perched on their sofa. Predictably the mother does not take this well ending the conversation by swearing at her daughter.\u00a0\u00a0. Although her mother may not have found the joke funny, after posting a photo of the messages on Twitter, Lily received 18,000 retweets and 25,000 favourites.",
