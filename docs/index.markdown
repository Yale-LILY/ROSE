This is a demo page for our **ROSE** ðŸŒ¹ benchmark of our paper ["Revisiting the Gold Standard:
Grounding Summarization Evaluation with Robust Human Evaluation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07981).

We provide the following interfaces for browsing the dataset.

## RoSE ðŸŒ¹ Benchmark

RoSE can be downloaded with Hugging Face Datasets under [`Salesforce/rose`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Salesforce/rose).

### ACU Annotations

RoSE benchmark contains system outputs annotated with our ACU protocol. 
It contains four parts:
- CNNDM, test set annotations
- CNNDM, validation set annotations
- XSum, test set annotations
- SamSum, test set annotations

We summarize the statistics below.

| Dataset | Split | #Doc. | #Sys. | #Total Summ. | HF Name
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CNNDM | Test | 500 | 12 | 6000 | `cnndm_test` |
| CNNDM | Validation | 1000 | 8 | 8000 | `cnndm_validation` |
| XSum  | Test | 500 | 8 | 4000 | `xsum` |
| SamSum  | Test | 500 | 8 | 4000 | `samsum` |

###  Human Annotations with Different Evaluation Protocols

We have system outputs annotated with four different human evaluation protocols in total.
We summarize them below.

| Protocol | w/ Input Document | w/ Reference Summary | Fine-grained |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Prior |  âœ— | âœ— | âœ— | 
| Ref-free | âœ“ | âœ— | âœ— |
| Ref-based | âœ— | âœ“ | âœ— |
| ACU | âœ— | âœ“ | âœ“ |

We annotated two sets of system summaries.

1. Summaries of 12 fine-tuned systems. The huggingface data split name is `cnndm_protocol`.
2. Zero-shot summaries from large langauge models (GPT3, T0), together with summaries from BRIO and BART. The huggingface data split name is `cnndm_protocol_gpt3`.
